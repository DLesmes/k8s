# Kubernetes Architecture: Nodes, Pods, and Key Components 🏗️

## Summary 📋

Container orchestration with Kubernetes represents one of the most significant advances in modern application management. Its robust and elegant architecture allows companies to deploy scalable and fault-tolerant solutions in real production environments. Below, we'll explore in detail the components that make Kubernetes such a powerful and versatile tool for cloud application deployment. 🎭

For comprehensive information about Kubernetes architecture and features, visit the [official Kubernetes website](https://kubernetes.io/).

## How is the Kubernetes Architecture Structured? 🏛️

The Kubernetes architecture is fundamentally based on servers organized into two main categories: **master nodes** and **worker nodes**. This hierarchical structure allows for clear separation of responsibilities within the cluster. 🏢

**Master nodes** house what is known as the "control plane," the operational brain of Kubernetes. For production environments, it's recommended to have more than one server in this layer to ensure high availability and resilience against failures. In smaller development environments, a single master node may be sufficient. 🎭

On the other hand, **worker nodes** (also called slaves) are responsible for managing computational workloads. The number of worker nodes varies according to the volume of running applications and the system's resource requirements. ⚙️

## What are the Key Components of the Control Plane? 🎛️

When examining master nodes in detail, we find several essential components that make up the control plane:

### API Server 🚪
It's the entry point for all communication within the cluster. When you run a command like `kubectl get pods`, it reaches the API Server, which communicates with other components to provide the appropriate response.

### etcd 💾
This high-concurrency key-value database records every change made, ensuring the cluster always maintains its desired state updated. It functions as the persistent "memory" of Kubernetes.

### Controller Manager 🎮
It's not a single controller, but a set of them that monitor different aspects of the cluster:

- **Node Controller**: Verifies the health of all nodes
- **Replication Controller**: Ensures the correct number of pods exist
- **Endpoint Controller**: Manages communication between services

### Scheduler 📅
Decides on which node each pod will run, based on required resources (CPU, memory, GPU) and available resources on each worker node.

## What Components are Found in Worker Nodes? 🔧

Worker nodes contain equally important components:

### Kubelet 🎮
This agent runs on each worker node and communicates with the API Server to ensure containers function correctly. If it detects errors, it reports them so corrective actions can be taken.

### kube-proxy 🌐
Manages the cluster's network layer, facilitating communication between pods and with the outside world.

### Container Runtime Interface (CRI) 🐳
It's responsible for running containers within the node. Although Docker was previously used by default, recent versions of Kubernetes have migrated to containerd.

## How are Workloads Organized in Kubernetes? 📦

Kubernetes uses important concepts to organize and manage workloads efficiently:

### What are Namespaces and What is Their Function? 🏷️

Namespaces provide logical separation of resources within the cluster. This organization depends on each company's specific use case:

- Some teams define namespaces by application type (frontend/backend)
- Others prefer to organize by functional teams (payments, user interface, API)
- The important thing is that Kubernetes adapts to any use case without issues

Within these namespaces live the pods, which are the fundamental unit of Kubernetes. A pod can contain one or multiple containers, depending on specific needs.

### How do Services Manage Communication in Kubernetes? 🔗

Services are components that accept traffic and redirect it to specific groups of pods. There are different types:

- **NodePort**: Primarily used in development environments, exposes a specific port on each worker node to allow external communication to pods. Not recommended for production environments.

- **ClusterIP**: Allows internal communication within the cluster through a specific IP. Facilitates load balancing between pods associated with the same application.

- **LoadBalancer**: When working with Kubernetes in the cloud, this type of service automatically creates a load balancer in the cloud service provider, ensuring more scalable and resilient traffic.

- **ExternalName**: Highly recommended for production environments, allows mapping a public name (like an RDS database in AWS) to a private name within the cluster. Optimizes communication times between internal and external services.

## How Does an Application Flow Work in Kubernetes? 🔄

Deploying an application in Kubernetes follows a well-defined process:

1. **Pod Deployment** 🎭: A pod is deployed within a specific namespace
2. **Scheduler Decision** 📅: The scheduler determines which worker node to place it on
3. **Container Startup** 🚀: The kubelet on that node starts the corresponding container
4. **Network Layer** 🌐: The kube-proxy establishes the network layer to allow communications
5. **Service Routing** 🔄: Services (like an Ingress or load balancer) redirect HTTP requests from the internet to the correct pods

This complete process allows Kubernetes to act as a true orchestra conductor, coordinating all elements so that our application functions optimally, scalably, and resilient to failures. 🎼

## Conclusion 🎉

Kubernetes architecture represents an elegant solution to modern computing challenges, enabling resilient and scalable deployments regardless of application complexity. The combination of master and worker nodes, along with the sophisticated control plane components, creates a robust foundation for container orchestration that can handle everything from simple applications to complex microservices architectures. 🌟

# Introduction to Kubernetes API and Kubectl 🎮

## Summary 📋

How to configure and start working with Kubernetes using MiniKube? Knowing how to configure and manage Kubernetes efficiently is fundamental for any professional in the DevOps or systems administration area. With a cluster configured with MiniKube, we can begin exploring Kubernetes capabilities. Below, we offer you a step-by-step guide based on best practices so you can make the most of the tools at your disposal. 🛠️

For additional comprehensive notes and resources, check out the [Kubernetes Introduction Notes](https://memoescalona.notion.site/Kubernetes-Introducci-n-1b44fd7dd88780e89717f2ac4835ff5f).

## What is the First Step to Start with MiniKube and Kubernetes? 🚀

First, you must have the local cluster configured with MiniKube. This is an essential tool that allows you to manage your cluster locally, offering a flexible platform for different configurations, such as working with multiple nodes or different versions of Kubernetes. To start the cluster, we use the command:

```bash
minikube start --driver=docker
```

This command, in addition to lifting the cluster, can be complemented with various specific parameters according to your needs, such as the driver you prefer to use. ⚙️

## What is KubeCTL and How Do We Interact with Kubernetes? 🎮

KubeCTL is the essential bridge to your Kubernetes cluster's API server. Through it, we can make a variety of requests such as create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) resources. A basic example to query resources is the command:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

With this, we can list the active pods in our current namespace. However, to get more details, we can use:

```bash
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

## What are Namespaces and How to Manage Them? 🏷️

Namespaces are crucial for organizing and logically separating resources within Kubernetes. By default, the cluster has a "default" namespace, but you can create and delete additional ones as needed:

### Create a new namespace:

```bash
kubectl create namespace k8s-demo
```

### Validate namespace creation:

```bash
kubectl get namespaces
```

### Delete a namespace:

```bash
kubectl delete namespace k8s-demo
```

## How Do We Manage Nodes Within Kubernetes? 🖥️

An important aspect of Kubernetes is managing the nodes that make up the cluster, where we perform operations with:

### List nodes:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

### Describe a node:

```bash
kubectl describe node
```

These commands provide valuable information about the node's role, status, and resources.

## How Are Declarative and Imperative Operator Configurations Applied? ⚙️

Kubernetes allows two styles for managing configurations:

- **Declarative**: Uses YAML files to define the desired state of the system.
- **Imperative**: Executes commands directly to carry out a specific action.

To apply a pod using a YAML file imperatively, we use:

```bash
kubectl apply -f simple-pod.yaml
```

And to delete that pod if it's no longer needed:

```bash
kubectl delete pod <pod-name>
```

## How to Keep Our Cluster in Top Shape with MiniKube? 🔧

To customize our cluster and expand its functionalities, MiniKube offers various add-ons. Some essential ones for improving management are:

### Metric Server: 
For obtaining cluster metrics and auto-scaling possibilities.

```bash
minikube addons enable metrics-server
```

### Registry: 
Links the Docker registry with MiniKube.

```bash
minikube addons enable registry
```

These components are critical for efficient handling and smooth development within Kubernetes.

## Essential Kubectl Commands Cheat Sheet 📝

Here are some essential commands to get you started:

### Basic Resource Management:
```bash
# Get all pods
kubectl get pods

# Get all services
kubectl get services

# Get all deployments
kubectl get deployments

# Get detailed information about a pod
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>

# Get logs from a pod
kubectl logs <pod-name>
```

### Context and Configuration:
```bash
# Get current context
kubectl config current-context

# List all contexts
kubectl config get-contexts

# Switch context
kubectl config use-context <context-name>
```

### Resource Creation and Management:
```bash
# Create a resource from a file
kubectl apply -f <filename.yaml>

# Delete a resource
kubectl delete <resource-type> <resource-name>

# Edit a resource
kubectl edit <resource-type> <resource-name>
```

## Conclusion 🎉

Now that we've explored the basics for interacting with and managing Kubernetes with MiniKube and KubeCTL, it's time to learn how to deploy complex applications. The combination of declarative and imperative approaches, along with proper namespace management and add-on configuration, provides a solid foundation for Kubernetes operations. 

Continue exploring and learn more about deploying frontend and backend applications with Kubernetes! The journey to becoming a Kubernetes expert continues with hands-on practice and real-world application deployment. 🌟

# Differences Between Declarative and Imperative Approaches 🎯

## Summary 📋

Using Kubernetes in professional environments requires understanding its two fundamental working approaches: imperative and declarative. Both methodologies have specific purposes that developers and systems administrators must master to efficiently manage their clusters. Knowing when and how to use each approach can make the difference between a successful implementation and problems in production. 🎯

## What is the Difference Between Imperative and Declarative Approaches in Kubernetes? 🤔

Resource management in Kubernetes can be performed following two distinct philosophies, each with particular characteristics that determine their suitability according to the context of use.

## Imperative Approach: Direct and Precise Commands 🎮

The imperative approach in Kubernetes is based on giving direct instructions to the cluster through specific commands. It's like an orchestra conductor giving clear and concise instructions to the musicians:

```bash
kubectl run mypod --image nginx
```

With this command, we are explicitly telling Kubernetes to create a pod called "mypod" using the nginx image. The execution of this command generates an immediate response:

```
pod/mypod created
```

To verify that the pod has been created correctly, we can use another imperative command:

```bash
kubectl get pod
```

And we'll get information about the created pod, including its status, runtime, and restarts. Similarly, we can delete the pod with:

```bash
kubectl delete pod mypod
```

### The imperative approach is ideal for:

- **Quick problem debugging** 🔍
- **Ephemeral testing** ⚡
- **Rapid validations in development environments** 🧪
- **Learning and familiarization with Kubernetes** 📚

However, it presents important limitations for production environments, mainly because it's difficult to maintain over time and doesn't provide a clear history of changes made.

## Declarative Approach: Definition of Desired States 📝

The declarative approach works differently: instead of indicating step by step what Kubernetes should do, we define the desired final state in YAML files. Following the musical analogy, this would be like providing a complete score to the orchestra:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
```

To apply this configuration, we use:

```bash
kubectl apply -f mypod.yaml
```

And to delete the resource:

```bash
kubectl delete -f mypod.yaml
```

### The declarative approach offers crucial advantages:

- **YAML files are versionable in systems like Git** 📂
- **Facilitate change auditing** 📝
- **Allow complete and complex resource definitions** 🏗️
- **Are readable and maintainable by diverse teams** 👥
- **Provide clear documentation of infrastructure** 📋

However, this approach has a steeper learning curve due to YAML syntax, which can be unintuitive at first.

## Why is it Important to Master Both Approaches in Kubernetes? 🎯

Understanding and managing both imperative and declarative approaches is fundamental for any professional working with Kubernetes:

The **imperative approach** allows quick interactions with the cluster, which is invaluable during development, testing, and troubleshooting. Imagine you need to quickly verify if a specific pod is working correctly; it would be cumbersome to create a YAML file for such a simple test.

The **declarative approach**, on the other hand, is crucial for production environments where consistency, reproducibility, and version control are essential. It allows defining complex resources with precision and maintaining a clear record of the desired configuration.

## Practical Cases for Each Approach 🔧

### Imperative Approach:

- **Real-time problem diagnosis** 🔍
- **Quick configuration testing** ⚡
- **Component functionality verification** ✅
- **Learning and experimentation environments** 🧪

### Declarative Approach:

- **Application deployment in production environments** 🚀
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** 🏗️
- **Complex configurations with multiple interrelated resources** 🔗
- **Long-term cluster resource management** 📈

## How to Implement Both Approaches in Real Applications? 🌟

In real-world applications, we rarely work with a single pod as in our example. Applications typically involve multiple components such as Deployments, ReplicaSets, Services, and other Kubernetes resources.

For proper scaling, it's recommended to:

1. **Use the imperative approach for initial testing and quick verifications** ⚡
2. **Transform those successful configurations into YAML files for declarative implementation** 📝
3. **Maintain these YAML files in version-controlled repositories** 📂
4. **Implement CI/CD processes that apply these files automatically** 🔄

The YAML format, although initially complex, is widely used in the DevOps and cloud ecosystem, including tools like GitHub Actions and Jenkins. Mastering this syntax will benefit not only your work with Kubernetes but also with other ecosystem tools.

## Comparison Table: Imperative vs Declarative 📊

| Aspect | Imperative Approach | Declarative Approach |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Syntax** | Command-line instructions | YAML/JSON files |
| **Learning Curve** | Easy to start | Steeper learning curve |
| **Version Control** | Difficult to track | Excellent with Git |
| **Reproducibility** | Manual steps required | Fully reproducible |
| **Production Ready** | Limited | Highly recommended |
| **Use Case** | Development/Testing | Production/CI-CD |
| **Maintenance** | Difficult over time | Easy to maintain |

## Best Practices for Each Approach 💡

### Imperative Best Practices:
- Use for quick testing and debugging
- Document commands for team reference
- Convert successful configurations to declarative format
- Use aliases for frequently used commands

### Declarative Best Practices:
- Use meaningful names and labels
- Implement proper resource limits and requests
- Use namespaces for organization
- Implement health checks and probes
- Use ConfigMaps and Secrets for configuration

## Conclusion 🎉

The effective combination of both approaches allows you to create scalable and robust applications in real environments. Practice is key to becoming familiar with YAML syntax and the different Kubernetes objects, which will eventually allow you to take full advantage of this powerful container orchestration platform.

The choice between imperative and declarative approaches depends on your specific use case, but mastering both will make you a more versatile and effective Kubernetes practitioner. Remember that the declarative approach is generally preferred for production environments, while the imperative approach excels in development and troubleshooting scenarios. 🌟

# Pods, ReplicaSets, and Deployments 📦

## Summary 📋

How to access resources in Kubernetes with Kubectl? When working with Kubernetes, the Kubectl command is our gateway to interact with resources. To begin, it's fundamental to see how to access pods and understand the core building blocks of Kubernetes applications. This class covers the essential concepts of Pods, ReplicaSets, and Deployments - the foundation of any Kubernetes application. 🎯

## How to Access Resources in Kubernetes with Kubectl? 🚀

When working with Kubernetes, the Kubectl command is our gateway to interact with resources. To begin, it's fundamental to see how to access pods:

### Get Pods: 
Execute `kubectl get pods`. If you don't specify a namespace, the default namespace will be used.

Now, what do we know about namespaces?

### Validate Namespaces: 
Use `kubectl get namespaces` to see existing namespaces, which include default, kube-node-lease, kube-public, and kube-system.

These namespaces, especially those starting with "kube", are for internal Kubernetes use. But if you want to create new namespaces:

### Create Namespace: 
Implement `create namespace` or its short form `create ns`.

## How to Manage Pods Efficiently? 🚀

When working with pods, two approaches are handled: imperative and declarative. These approaches offer different ways to create and manage pods, and we want to share some examples.

### Imperative Approach with Kubectl 🚀

To illustrate pod creation in an imperative way, we'll use CLI (Command Line Interface) commands:

```bash
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx --restart=Never --port=80
```

When executing this, Kubernetes assumes several default parameters, such as IP address and container ID. Subsequently, we validate with:

### Describe a Pod: 
`kubectl describe pod <pod-name>`. Here you'll see conditions and states of the pod.

### Declarative Approach with YAML Files 📝

Kubernetes can also be managed declaratively with YAML files that detail specific configurations. These files are especially useful for automation and infrastructure as code management.

## How to Scale Applications with ReplicaSets? 📈

As you try to scale applications, ReplicaSets come into play. These are responsible for managing multiple instances of pods.

### Creating a ReplicaSet 🏗️

To create a ReplicaSet, use a YAML file with the following structure:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: example-replicaset
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

Implement with:

```bash
kubectl apply -f replicasets.yaml
```

### Verification and Maintenance 🔧

- **Observe ReplicaSets**: `kubectl get replicasets`
- **Delete a Pod**: When you delete it, the ReplicaSet automatically creates a new one to maintain the desired number of replicas

## What Role Do Deployments Play in Kubernetes? 🚀

Deployments act as the top layer, managing ReplicaSets and facilitating control over applications.

### Benefits of a Deployment 🎯

A deployment allows:

- **Continuous updates**: Implement new versions without interrupting service
- **Automatic rollback**: Revert failed updates
- **Rolling updates**: Update pods gradually without downtime
- **Version control**: Track different versions of your application

### Creating a Deployment 🏗️

Use the following YAML:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: example-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 4
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: hello-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: hello-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: hello-app
        image: google-samples/hello-app:1.0
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```

Implement with:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

### Image Updates 🔄

To update the image to a newer version, use:

```bash
kubectl set image deployment/example-deployment hello-app=google-samples/hello-app:2.0
```

### Validation and Monitoring 📊

- **View counters in deployments and ReplicaSets**: `kubectl get deployments` and `kubectl get replicasets`
- **Undo updates**: `kubectl rollout undo deployment/example-deployment`
- **Check rollout status**: `kubectl rollout status deployment/example-deployment`
- **View rollout history**: `kubectl rollout history deployment/example-deployment`

## How to Expose Traffic to Kubernetes? 🔄

To manage traffic between our local machine and pods, port-forward commands are used:

```bash
kubectl port-forward deployment/example-deployment 8080:8080
```

This redirects traffic to port 8080 of the deployment, allowing you to verify in the browser with localhost:8080.

## Understanding the Hierarchy: Pods → ReplicaSets → Deployments 📊

### Pods (The Basic Unit) 📦
- **What they are**: The smallest deployable units in Kubernetes
- **Purpose**: Run one or more containers
- **Lifecycle**: Can be created, updated, and deleted
- **Direct management**: Not recommended for production

### ReplicaSets (Ensuring Availability) 🔄
- **What they are**: Ensures a specified number of pod replicas are running
- **Purpose**: Maintain pod availability and scaling
- **Self-healing**: Automatically replaces failed pods
- **Scaling**: Can scale up or down based on demand

### Deployments (Production-Ready Management) 🚀
- **What they are**: Higher-level abstraction that manages ReplicaSets
- **Purpose**: Provide declarative updates for pods and ReplicaSets
- **Rolling updates**: Update applications without downtime
- **Rollback capability**: Revert to previous versions if needed

## Practical Examples and Commands 📝

### Working with Pods:
```bash
# Create a simple pod
kubectl run my-pod --image=nginx

# Get pod details
kubectl describe pod my-pod

# Get pod logs
kubectl logs my-pod

# Delete a pod
kubectl delete pod my-pod
```

### Working with ReplicaSets:
```bash
# Create ReplicaSet from file
kubectl apply -f replicaset.yaml

# Scale ReplicaSet
kubectl scale replicaset example-replicaset --replicas=5

# Get ReplicaSet details
kubectl describe replicaset example-replicaset
```

### Working with Deployments:
```bash
# Create deployment from file
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml

# Scale deployment
kubectl scale deployment example-deployment --replicas=6

# Update deployment image
kubectl set image deployment/example-deployment container-name=new-image:tag

# Rollback deployment
kubectl rollout undo deployment/example-deployment

# Check deployment status
kubectl rollout status deployment/example-deployment
```

## Best Practices 💡

### For Pods:
- Don't create pods directly in production
- Use Deployments instead
- Always specify resource limits and requests
- Use health checks (liveness and readiness probes)

### For ReplicaSets:
- Use Deployments instead of managing ReplicaSets directly
- ReplicaSets are managed automatically by Deployments
- Focus on the desired state rather than manual scaling

### For Deployments:
- Use meaningful names and labels
- Implement proper resource limits
- Use rolling update strategy
- Monitor rollout status
- Keep deployment history for rollbacks

## Conclusion 🎉

I invite everyone to share what they think about this Kubernetes workflow and how they could incorporate it into their future projects. These concepts are just the beginning for mastering application deployment and management in the cloud.

The combination of Pods, ReplicaSets, and Deployments provides a robust foundation for running applications in Kubernetes. Understanding how these components work together is essential for building scalable, reliable, and maintainable applications in the cloud. 🌟

Remember:
- **Pods** are the basic building blocks
- **ReplicaSets** ensure availability and scaling
- **Deployments** provide production-ready management with rolling updates and rollbacks

Continue exploring and practicing with these concepts to build your confidence in managing Kubernetes applications! 🚀

# Services and Ingress: Exposing Applications 🌐

## Summary 📋

The ability to expose applications to the outside world is fundamental in Kubernetes environments. Among the various available options, Ingress stands out for offering an additional layer of customization that goes beyond traditional services. Understanding the differences between these exposure mechanisms allows developers and systems administrators to choose the most suitable solution for each scenario. 🎯

## What Options Do We Have for Exposing Services in Kubernetes? 🔗

Before diving into Ingress, it's important to review the different types of services that Kubernetes offers for exposing applications:

### NodePort 
Exposes a specific port on each of the Kubernetes cluster nodes. This allows accepting traffic from the Internet or from within the cluster to a group of pods, simply by specifying the IP address and the configured port.

### ClusterIP 🏠
Assigns each service an IP within the cluster CIDR range. This type facilitates communication between different pods in the same namespace, different namespaces, or even different hosts, which is essential for applications exposed to the real world or microservices that need to communicate internally.

### LoadBalancer ⚖️
When working with a Kubernetes cluster in AWS, this type of service is automatically managed by AWS's network layer.

### ExternalName 🔗
Similar to CNAME records in DNS, acts as a wrapper for a well-constructed address (like a database address in AWS). These services allow adding caching and name resolution capabilities that optimize traffic from within the cluster to external services.

## What is Ingress and How Does It Differ from Other Services? 🚪

Ingress goes beyond the services mentioned above and provides advanced capabilities for exposing applications:

- **Allows load balancing** ⚖️
- **Offers SSL termination validation** 🔒
- **Facilitates virtual hosting management through paths and subpaths on registered hosts** 🌐

A typical use case would be a client wanting to access an application called "myapp.com". With Ingress, we can configure different routes:

- `api.myapp.com/login` that directs the user to backend services
- `myapp.com/dashboard` that leads to frontend services with user interfaces

This logical separation through domain names and paths makes applications much more accessible to end users.

## How to Implement an Ingress Controller in a Local Cluster? 🛠️

In Kubernetes, Ingress is highly customizable and there are different types of Ingress Controllers such as Nginx, Traefik, and HAProxy. In a local development environment with Minikube, we can implement it as follows:

### First, enable the Ingress addon in Minikube:
```bash
minikube addons enable ingress
```

### Verify that the Ingress Controller is working:
```bash
kubectl get pods -n ingress-nginx
```

### Deploy a sample application:
```bash
kubectl create deployment web --image=gcr.io/google-samples/hello-app:1.0
```

### Expose the application as a NodePort service:
```bash
kubectl expose deployment web --type=NodePort --port=8080
```

### Verify that the service is created correctly:
```bash
kubectl get service
```

### To access the application through NodePort in Minikube:
```bash
minikube service web --url
```

## How to Configure an Ingress for Our Application? ⚙️

To create an Ingress that points to our service, we need to define an Ingress resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: example-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - host: helloworld.example
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: web
            port:
              number: 8080
```

After applying this configuration with `kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml`, we can verify the Ingress status:

```bash
kubectl get ingress
kubectl describe ingress example-ingress
```

### DNS Resolution Configuration 🌐

For the Ingress to work correctly in a local environment, we must configure DNS resolution by editing the system's hosts file (`/etc/hosts` on macOS and Linux). We add an entry that points to our local IP:

```bash
127.0.0.1 helloworld.example
```

**Note for WSL Users**: If you're using WSL and having trouble visualizing in the browser, I also recommend adding `127.0.0.1 helloworld.example` to `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`.

### Enable Minikube Tunnel 🚇

Finally, we enable the Minikube tunnel to expose the Ingress:

```bash
minikube tunnel
```

Now we can access our application using the configured domain: `http://helloworld.example`

## What Advantages Does Ingress Offer in Production Environments? 🏭

In production environments, Ingress offers significant advantages:

- **Centralized route management**: Allows managing multiple services from a single entry point
- **TLS/SSL termination**: Facilitates SSL certificate configuration without needing to configure them on each service
- **Content-based routing**: Possibility to route traffic based on hosts, paths, or even headers
- **Cloud provider integration**: Major cloud providers offer optimized Ingress Controller implementations

## Service Types Comparison Table 📊

| Service Type | Use Case | External Access | Load Balancing | SSL/TLS |
|--------------|----------|-----------------|----------------|---------|
| **ClusterIP** | Internal communication | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| **NodePort** | Development/Testing | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| **LoadBalancer** | Production (Cloud) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **ExternalName** | External services | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Ingress** | Production (Advanced) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Practical Examples and Commands 📝

```

### Port Forwarding for Testing:

```bash
# Forward port to service
kubectl port-forward service/web 8080:8080

# Forward port to pod
kubectl port-forward pod/web-pod 8080:8080

# Forward port to deployment
kubectl port-forward deployment/web 8080:8080
```

## Best Practices 💡

### For Services:
- Use ClusterIP for internal communication
- Use NodePort only for development/testing
- Use LoadBalancer for production cloud environments
- Always specify resource limits and requests
- Use meaningful service names and labels

### For Ingress:
- Use meaningful hostnames and paths
- Implement proper SSL/TLS certificates
- Use annotations for controller-specific configurations
- Monitor Ingress controller performance
- Implement proper security policies

### Security Considerations 🔒:
- Use Network Policies to restrict traffic
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Use HTTPS in production environments
- Regularly update Ingress controllers
- Monitor for security vulnerabilities

## Troubleshooting Common Issues 🔧

### Service Not Accessible:
```bash
# Check service status
kubectl get services

# Check endpoints
kubectl get endpoints

# Check pod labels
kubectl get pods --show-labels
```

### Ingress Not Working:
```bash
# Check Ingress controller status
kubectl get pods -n ingress-nginx

# Check Ingress configuration
kubectl describe ingress <ingress-name>

# Check DNS resolution
nslookup <hostname>
```

## Conclusion 🎉

Ingress represents a powerful abstraction layer that simplifies traffic management in Kubernetes clusters, providing a more user-friendly experience for both developers and end users. Its flexibility allows it to be adapted to various scenarios, from local development environments to complex cloud infrastructures.

The combination of Services and Ingress provides a comprehensive solution for exposing applications in Kubernetes, from simple internal communication to complex production deployments with advanced routing and security features. 🌟

I invite you to experiment by creating your own deployment with a different name and configuring a custom Ingress for it. Share your results and learnings in the comments section! 🚀

Remember that mastering Services and Ingress is essential for building production-ready applications in Kubernetes, as they form the foundation of how your applications communicate with the outside world. 🌐

# ConfigMaps and Secrets: Configuration and Sensitive Data 🔐

## Summary 📋

ConfigMaps and Secrets are fundamental for protecting your application configuration in Kubernetes. Not implementing them properly could expose sensitive information and compromise the security of your deployments. These two resources allow you to separate configuration from code, following modern development best practices, and add additional security layers that every systems administrator should know. 🛡️

## What are ConfigMaps and Secrets in Kubernetes? 🤔

ConfigMaps and Secrets are Kubernetes objects that allow storing configuration information separate from the application code. However, they have different purposes and distinct security levels.

**ConfigMaps** are designed to store non-sensitive configuration data in key-value pair format. This data is stored in plain text and is easily accessible. On the other hand, **Secrets** are specifically designed to store confidential information such as passwords, OAuth tokens, SSH keys, and other sensitive data that should not be exposed. 🔒

To experiment with these objects, we can use the files provided in the `08-configs-secrets` folder of our project:

- A file to create a ConfigMap
- A file to create a Secret
- A README.md file with instructions and commands

## How to Create and Manage ConfigMaps? 📝

To create a ConfigMap declaratively, first we need to review the file structure. In the `autconfig.yaml` example, we find:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: autconfig
data:
  api_url: "https://api.example.com"
```

This file defines an object of type ConfigMap called "autconfig" that contains a URL as configuration data. To apply it in our cluster, we execute:

```bash
kubectl apply -f autconfig.yaml
```

Once created, we can verify its existence and content with the following commands:

```bash
kubectl get configmap
kubectl describe configmap autconfig
```

The `describe` command will show us the value in plain text, confirming that ConfigMaps store information without encryption. This is suitable for values such as:

- **Execution environments** (development, staging, production) ��️
- **Non-sensitive external service URLs** ��
- **Log levels** (debug, info, error) 📊

A good exercise is to create a ConfigMap with different types of variables like strings, integers, or other types to configure your application.

## How to Implement Secrets for Sensitive Information? ��

Unlike ConfigMaps, Secrets add an additional security layer by encoding values in base64. To create a Secret imperatively from the command line:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic autsecret --from-literal=client_id=myclientid --from-literal=client_secret=secret
```

This command creates a Secret called "autsecret" with two values: `client_id` and `client_secret`. Although we pass these values in plain text from the console (which is not a good practice in production), Kubernetes will store them encoded.

To verify the Secret creation:

```bash
kubectl get secret
kubectl describe secret autsecret
```

The `describe` command will show that we have "Opaque" type information and will indicate the size in bytes of each value, but will not directly show the data. To view or edit these values:

```bash
kubectl edit secret autsecret
```

This command will open an editor where we'll see the base64 encoded values. If we need to decode these values, we can use online tools or the `base64` command in the terminal.

It's important to note that although Secrets encode data in base64, this doesn't provide real encryption, only obfuscation. For environments with higher security requirements, it's recommended to consider solutions such as:

- **HashiCorp Vault** 🏦
- **External Secrets with AWS Secrets Manager** ☁️

## Best Practices for Configuration and Secrets Management 💡

Proper implementation of ConfigMaps and Secrets offers several benefits for your application architecture and security:

### Configuration Decoupling 🔗
Allows completely separating configuration from application code, facilitating maintenance and changes.

### Multi-Environment Support 🌍
You can create different ConfigMaps for each environment (development, testing, production) without changing the code.

### Secret Rotation 🔄
Secrets can be updated and rotated regularly without needing to rebuild and redeploy applications.

### Granular Access Control 🔐
Kubernetes allows defining access policies to determine which users or applications can access which secrets.

### External Solution Integration 🔗
For greater security, you can integrate solutions like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager through External Secrets.

## When to Use Each Type of Object? 🎯

### ConfigMaps: For non-sensitive configuration data that can be in plain text
- **Environment variables** 🌍
- **Non-confidential URLs** 🌐
- **Logging configuration** 📊
- **Application parameters** ⚙️

### Secrets: Exclusively for sensitive information
- **API keys** ��
- **Passwords** ��
- **Authentication tokens** 🎫
- **SSL certificates** 📜

## Practical Examples and Commands 📝

### Creating ConfigMaps:

```bash
# From file
kubectl apply -f configmap.yaml

# From literal values
kubectl create configmap my-config --from-literal=key1=value1 --from-literal=key2=value2

# From file content
kubectl create configmap my-config --from-file=config.properties

# From directory
kubectl create configmap my-config --from-file=./config/
```

### Creating Secrets:

```bash
# From literal values
kubectl create secret generic my-secret --from-literal=username=admin --from-literal=password=secret123

# From file
kubectl create secret generic my-secret --from-file=./secrets/

# From file content
kubectl create secret generic my-secret --from-file=username=./username.txt --from-file=password=./password.txt
```

### Managing ConfigMaps and Secrets:

```bash
# List all ConfigMaps
kubectl get configmaps

# List all Secrets
kubectl get secrets

# Describe ConfigMap
kubectl describe configmap my-config

# Describe Secret
kubectl describe secret my-secret

# Edit ConfigMap
kubectl edit configmap my-config

# Edit Secret
kubectl edit secret my-secret

# Delete ConfigMap
kubectl delete configmap my-config

# Delete Secret
kubectl delete secret my-secret
```

## Security Considerations 🔒

### ConfigMaps Security:
- ✅ Suitable for non-sensitive data
- ❌ Not encrypted (stored in plain text)
- ⚠️ Don't store passwords, keys, or tokens
- 📝 Use for configuration parameters, URLs, environment names

### Secrets Security:
- ✅ Base64 encoded (not encrypted)
- ⚠️ Not suitable for highly sensitive data in production
- 🔐 Consider external secret management solutions
- 🔄 Implement regular secret rotation

## Advanced Secret Management Solutions 🚀

### HashiCorp Vault:
```bash
# Install Vault
helm repo add hashicorp https://helm.releases.hashicorp.com
helm install vault hashicorp/vault

# Configure External Secrets Operator
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/external-secrets/external-secrets/main/config/samples/secretstore.yaml
```

### AWS Secrets Manager:
```yaml
apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1beta1
kind: SecretStore
metadata:
  name: aws-secret-store
spec:
  provider:
    aws:
      service: SecretsManager
      region: us-west-2
```

## Using ConfigMaps and Secrets in Pods 🐳

### As Environment Variables:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: nginx

    - name: PASSWORD
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: my-secret
          key: password
```

### As Volumes:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: nginx
    volumeMounts:
    - name: config-volume
      mountPath: /etc/config
    - name: secret-volume
      mountPath: /etc/secrets
  volumes:
  - name: config-volume
    configMap:
      name: my-config
  - name: secret-volume
    secret:
      secretName: my-secret
```

## Best Practices Summary ��

### Do's ✅:
- Use ConfigMaps for non-sensitive configuration
- Use Secrets for sensitive data
- Implement proper RBAC for access control
- Use external secret management for production
- Regularly rotate secrets
- Use meaningful names and labels

### Don'ts ❌:
- Store sensitive data in ConfigMaps
- Commit secrets to version control
- Use base64 encoding as real encryption
- Share secrets across namespaces unnecessarily
- Use default service accounts for secret access

## Conclusion 🎉

The next step in our learning will be discovering how to integrate these ConfigMaps and Secrets with our Pods and Deployments so that our applications can use these configurations. This involves understanding how to mount these resources as environment variables or as volumes within containers.

Proper management of configurations and secrets is fundamental for maintaining secure and easily maintainable applications in Kubernetes. We encourage you to experiment by creating your own ConfigMaps and Secrets, integrating them into your applications, and exploring more advanced solutions for production environments with high security requirements. 🌟

Remember that security is not just about protecting data, but also about implementing proper practices and using the right tools for each scenario. Start with ConfigMaps and Secrets, then evolve to more sophisticated solutions as your security requirements grow! 🔐

# Kubernetes Network Model: Pods and Services 🌐

## Summary 📋

The Kubernetes network represents one of the most sophisticated components of its architecture, allowing pods and services to communicate seamlessly regardless of where they are physically hosted. This transparent communication capability is fundamental for building robust and scalable distributed applications, and understanding how this network model works helps us solve problems and optimize our implementations. 🎯

## How Does the Network Model Work in Kubernetes? ⚙️

The Kubernetes network model is based on an apparently simple but technically complex concept: **flat networking between pods**. This feature allows each pod to communicate directly with any other pod in the cluster, even if they are on different nodes or workers.

This design is based on three main rules:

### 1. Direct Node Communication 🔗
All nodes must be able to connect to each other without needing Network Address Translation (NAT). This means that workers or nodes are on the same network and have direct communication between them.

### 2. Direct Pod Communication ��
Communication must be direct between pods. This transparency allows a pod in one namespace (for example, frontend) to communicate with another pod in a different namespace (like backend) using simply IP addresses or service names.

### 3. Shared Network Segment 🌐
Pods and services share the same network segment. This configuration facilitates communication between services and the groups of pods associated with deployments or other Kubernetes objects.

## Key Components of Networking in Kubernetes 🏗️

The Kubernetes network works thanks to several components that work coordinately:

### Container Network Interface (CNI) 🔌
It's an interface that allows using different plugins to manage the network. Among the most popular options stand out:

- **Calico** 🦔: Highly recommended in the community for its ease of learning and adaptability to multiple use cases.
- **Flannel** 🧶: Offers similar capabilities for network configuration, although it presents some limitations in security aspects.

### kube-proxy 🌐
This component, which we've talked about previously, uses IPTables (Linux mechanism) for request routing. When someone tries to access a pod, kube-proxy:

1. **Receives the request** 📥
2. **Redirects it to the appropriate pods of the service** 🔄
3. **Updates routes in IPTables when there are changes** ��

### CoreDNS ��
It's the component responsible for service discovery, allowing the use of service names to reference specific groups of pods or services within the cluster.

## The OSI and TCP/IP Model in Kubernetes 📊

From a technical perspective, Kubernetes uses the practical TCP/IP model (based on the theoretical OSI model):

- **Pods communicate using layer 3 (network)**, employing routing and IP protocol.
- **Services use upper layer protocols (application and transport)**, taking advantage of TCP, UDP, and load balancing mechanisms.

## Why is the Network Model Important in Kubernetes? ��

The sophisticated Kubernetes network model is what allows our distributed applications to work in a coordinated manner. A Kubernetes cluster can run in various environments:

- **In the cloud** ☁️
- **In on-premise environments** 🏢
- **In virtual machines within the same host** 💻

In all these cases, the Kubernetes network ensures that components can communicate properly, maintaining the availability, fault tolerance, and resilience of our applications.

## Service Discovery and Its Importance 🔍

CoreDNS plays a fundamental role in the Kubernetes architecture, handling service discovery between services and associated pod groups. This allows any component to be reached both internally and externally, without worrying about knowing the exact IP addresses of each element.

## Network Architecture Deep Dive 🏛️

### Pod Network Model ��
```yaml
# Example: Pod with network configuration
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
      protocol: TCP
```

### Service Network Model ��
```yaml
# Example: Service exposing pods
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: example-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
  type: ClusterIP
```

## Network Policies and Security 🔒

### Network Policy Example:
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: default-deny
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
```

### Allowing Specific Traffic:
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-web-traffic
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: web
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: frontend
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
```

## Practical Network Commands and Tools 🛠️

### Network Troubleshooting Commands:
```bash
# Check pod network connectivity
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- ping <target-pod-ip>

# Check service endpoints
kubectl get endpoints <service-name>

# Check network policies
kubectl get networkpolicies

# Check DNS resolution
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- nslookup <service-name>

# Check pod network configuration
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
```

### Network Debugging Tools:
```bash
# Install network debugging tools in a pod
kubectl run debug-pod --image=nicolaka/netshoot --rm -it

# Check network interfaces
kubectl exec -it debug-pod -- ip addr

# Check routing table
kubectl exec -it debug-pod -- ip route

# Check DNS configuration
kubectl exec -it debug-pod -- cat /etc/resolv.conf
```

## Network Performance and Optimization 📈

### Best Practices for Network Performance:
- **Use appropriate CNI plugins** for your use case
- **Implement network policies** for security
- **Monitor network metrics** regularly
- **Optimize service mesh** configurations if using Istio/Linkerd
- **Use appropriate service types** (ClusterIP vs NodePort vs LoadBalancer)

### Network Monitoring:
```bash
# Check network metrics
kubectl top pods

# Monitor network policies
kubectl get networkpolicies --all-namespaces

# Check service endpoints
kubectl get endpoints --all-namespaces
```

## Common Network Issues and Solutions ��

```bash
# Check if pods are in the same namespace
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces

# Verify service configuration
kubectl describe service <service-name>

# Check network policies
kubectl get networkpolicies
```

### Issue 2: DNS Resolution Problems
```bash
# Check CoreDNS pods
kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-dns

# Check CoreDNS logs
kubectl logs -n kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-dns

# Test DNS resolution
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- nslookup kubernetes.default
```

### Issue 3: Service Not Accessible
```bash
# Check service endpoints
kubectl get endpoints <service-name>

# Verify pod labels match service selector
kubectl get pods --show-labels
kubectl describe service <service-name>
```

## Network Security Considerations 🛡️

### Security Best Practices:
- **Implement network policies** to restrict traffic
- **Use service mesh** for advanced security features
- **Encrypt traffic** between services
- **Monitor network traffic** for anomalies
- **Regular security audits** of network configurations

### Network Policy Examples:
```yaml
# Deny all traffic by default
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: default-deny-all
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
```

## Advanced Networking Features 🚀

### Service Mesh Integration:
- **Istio**: Advanced traffic management and security

# Service Types: ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, and ExternalName 🌐

## Summary 📋

How to expose applications in Kubernetes? When working with Kubernetes, one of the most important challenges is learning how to expose our applications to the outside world. That is, enabling the connection of our applications deployed in a cluster with external users. In the Kubernetes ecosystem, there are four main components used for this task: NodePort, ClusterIP, LoadBalancer, and ExternalName. 🎯

## How to Expose Applications in Kubernetes? ��

When working with Kubernetes, one of the most important challenges is learning how to expose our applications to the outside world. That is, enabling the connection of our applications deployed in a cluster with external users. In the Kubernetes ecosystem, there are four main components used for this task: NodePort, ClusterIP, LoadBalancer, and ExternalName.

## What is a NodePort? 🚪

The NodePort concept is essential within Kubernetes. This type of service allows us to expose a pod on a specific port of each node in the cluster. It's notable that in more advanced scenarios, such as using MiniKube, you can create multi-node clusters.

To configure it, the first thing you must do is define this service in a YAML file. A basic example includes the following elements:

- **Metadata** to relate the service with a ReplicaSet, Deployment, or Pod
- **containerPort** that the deployment uses (e.g., 8080)
- **nodePort** that allows connecting external traffic to the pod

Here's how a configuration file would look:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: hello-nodeport
spec:
  selector:
    app: HelloNodePort
  type: NodePort
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
      nodePort: 30007
```

To implement this service, use the command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment-nodeport.yaml
```

### NodePort Use Cases 🎯
- **Development and testing environments** 🧪
- **Local cluster access** 💻
- **Quick application exposure** ⚡
- **Multi-node cluster scenarios** 🔗

## What is ClusterIP Used For? 🏠

The ClusterIP service type is used when you want to expose applications within the same cluster. This functionality is ideal when several microservices or applications need to communicate with each other within the cluster.

The configuration is quite similar to NodePort, but focused on internal connectivity. Here, the service takes a specific IP address from the CIDR range assigned to the cluster.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: hello-cluster-ip
spec:
  selector:
    app: HelloClusterIP
  type: ClusterIP
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
```

To deploy this service, use:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment-clusterip.yaml
```

### ClusterIP Use Cases ��
- **Internal microservice communication** 🔄
- **Database access within cluster** 💾
- **API gateway internal routing** 🚪
- **Service-to-service communication** 🤝

## How is a LoadBalancer Managed? ⚖️

This is the appropriate service when working in cloud environments such as AWS, GCP, or Azure. When a LoadBalancer type service is detected, the cloud provider automatically deploys an instance that will manage the traffic.

Here's an example configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: hello-loadbalancer
spec:
  selector:
    app: HelloLoadBalancer
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
```

The command to apply it is:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment-loadbalancer.yaml
```

### LoadBalancer Use Cases 🎯
- **Production cloud environments** ☁️
- **High availability applications** 🛡️
- **Auto-scaling scenarios** 📈
- **Multi-region deployments** 🌍

## What is an ExternalName and When to Use It? 🔗

The ExternalName service is very useful for connecting Kubernetes with third-party resources, such as external databases. Unlike the previous types, ExternalName doesn't manage direct pods, but rather encapsulates the URL of the external resource, facilitating its use and refactoring in large applications.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-database-service
spec:
  type: ExternalName
  externalName: database.example.com
```

To create this resource, simply execute:

```bash
kubectl apply -f externalname.yaml
```

### ExternalName Use Cases 🎯
- **External database connections** 💾

## Service Types Comparison Table 📊

| Service Type | Use Case | External Access | Load Balancing | Cloud Integration | Complexity |
|--------------|----------|-----------------|----------------|-------------------|------------|
| **ClusterIP** | Internal communication | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | Low |
| **NodePort** | Development/Testing | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | Medium |
| **LoadBalancer** | Production (Cloud) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | High |
| **ExternalName** | External services | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | Low |

## Practical Examples and Commands 📝

### Creating Different Service Types:

```bash
# ClusterIP (default)
kubectl expose deployment my-app --port=80

# NodePort
kubectl expose deployment my-app --type=NodePort --port=80

# LoadBalancer
kubectl expose deployment my-app --type=LoadBalancer --port=80

# ExternalName
kubectl create service externalname my-db --external-name=my-database.aws.com
```

### Managing Services:

```bash
# List all services
kubectl get services

# Describe a service
kubectl describe service <service-name>

# Edit a service
kubectl edit service <service-name>

# Delete a service
kubectl delete service <service-name>
```

### Service Discovery:

```bash
# Get service endpoints
kubectl get endpoints <service-name>

# Check service DNS
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- nslookup <service-name>

# Port forwarding for testing
kubectl port-forward service/<service-name> 8080:80
```

## Advanced Service Configurations 🚀

### Multi-Port Services:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: multi-port-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
  - name: http
    protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
  - name: https
    protocol: TCP
    port: 443
    targetPort: 8443
```

### Session Affinity:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: session-affinity-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
  sessionAffinity: ClientIP
  sessionAffinityConfig:
    clientIP:
      timeoutSeconds: 3600
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
```

### External Traffic Policy:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: external-traffic-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
  type: LoadBalancer
  externalTrafficPolicy: Local
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
```

## Best Practices ��

### For ClusterIP:
- Use for internal service communication
- Implement proper service discovery
- Use meaningful service names
- Consider using service mesh for complex scenarios

### For NodePort:
- Use only for development/testing
- Avoid in production environments
- Be aware of port conflicts
- Use specific port ranges (30000-32767)

### For LoadBalancer:
- Use in cloud environments
- Monitor costs (cloud load balancers have charges)
- Implement proper health checks
- Consider using Ingress for multiple services

### For ExternalName:
- Use for external service abstraction
- Document external dependencies
- Consider security implications
- Use for gradual migration strategies

## Troubleshooting Common Issues 🔧

### Service Not Accessible:
```bash
# Check service status
kubectl get services

# Check endpoints
kubectl get endpoints <service-name>

# Check pod labels
kubectl get pods --show-labels
kubectl describe service <service-name>
```

### NodePort Not Working:
```bash
# Check node port allocation
kubectl get service <service-name> -o yaml

# Verify node accessibility
kubectl get nodes -o wide

# Check firewall rules
kubectl describe node <node-name>
```

### LoadBalancer Issues:
```bash
# Check cloud provider integration
kubectl describe service <service-name>

# Monitor load balancer status
kubectl get events --sort-by='.lastTimestamp'

# Check cloud provider logs
kubectl logs -n kube-system <cloud-controller-manager-pod>
```

## Security Considerations 🔒

### Network Policies:
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-service-access
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          name: frontend
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
```

### Service Security:
- Implement proper RBAC for service access
- Use network policies to restrict traffic
- Monitor service access logs
- Regularly audit service configurations

## Performance Optimization 📈

### Service Performance Tips:
- Use appropriate service types for your use case
- Implement connection pooling where needed
- Monitor service latency and throughput
- Use service mesh for advanced traffic management
- Consider using headless services for direct pod access

### Monitoring Services:
```bash
# Check service metrics
kubectl top pods

# Monitor service endpoints
kubectl get endpoints --watch

# Check service logs
kubectl logs -l app=my-app
```
