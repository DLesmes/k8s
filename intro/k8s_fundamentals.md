# Kubernetes Architecture: Nodes, Pods, and Key Components 🏗️

## Summary 📋

Container orchestration with Kubernetes represents one of the most significant advances in modern application management. Its robust and elegant architecture allows companies to deploy scalable and fault-tolerant solutions in real production environments. Below, we'll explore in detail the components that make Kubernetes such a powerful and versatile tool for cloud application deployment. 🎭

For comprehensive information about Kubernetes architecture and features, visit the [official Kubernetes website](https://kubernetes.io/).

## How is the Kubernetes Architecture Structured? 🏛️

The Kubernetes architecture is fundamentally based on servers organized into two main categories: **master nodes** and **worker nodes**. This hierarchical structure allows for clear separation of responsibilities within the cluster. 🏢

**Master nodes** house what is known as the "control plane," the operational brain of Kubernetes. For production environments, it's recommended to have more than one server in this layer to ensure high availability and resilience against failures. In smaller development environments, a single master node may be sufficient. 🎭

On the other hand, **worker nodes** (also called slaves) are responsible for managing computational workloads. The number of worker nodes varies according to the volume of running applications and the system's resource requirements. ⚙️

## What are the Key Components of the Control Plane? 🎛️

When examining master nodes in detail, we find several essential components that make up the control plane:

### API Server 🚪
It's the entry point for all communication within the cluster. When you run a command like `kubectl get pods`, it reaches the API Server, which communicates with other components to provide the appropriate response.

### etcd 💾
This high-concurrency key-value database records every change made, ensuring the cluster always maintains its desired state updated. It functions as the persistent "memory" of Kubernetes.

### Controller Manager 🎮
It's not a single controller, but a set of them that monitor different aspects of the cluster:

- **Node Controller**: Verifies the health of all nodes
- **Replication Controller**: Ensures the correct number of pods exist
- **Endpoint Controller**: Manages communication between services

### Scheduler 📅
Decides on which node each pod will run, based on required resources (CPU, memory, GPU) and available resources on each worker node.

## What Components are Found in Worker Nodes? 🔧

Worker nodes contain equally important components:

### Kubelet 🎮
This agent runs on each worker node and communicates with the API Server to ensure containers function correctly. If it detects errors, it reports them so corrective actions can be taken.

### kube-proxy 🌐
Manages the cluster's network layer, facilitating communication between pods and with the outside world.

### Container Runtime Interface (CRI) 🐳
It's responsible for running containers within the node. Although Docker was previously used by default, recent versions of Kubernetes have migrated to containerd.

## How are Workloads Organized in Kubernetes? 📦

Kubernetes uses important concepts to organize and manage workloads efficiently:

### What are Namespaces and What is Their Function? 🏷️

Namespaces provide logical separation of resources within the cluster. This organization depends on each company's specific use case:

- Some teams define namespaces by application type (frontend/backend)
- Others prefer to organize by functional teams (payments, user interface, API)
- The important thing is that Kubernetes adapts to any use case without issues

Within these namespaces live the pods, which are the fundamental unit of Kubernetes. A pod can contain one or multiple containers, depending on specific needs.

### How do Services Manage Communication in Kubernetes? 🔗

Services are components that accept traffic and redirect it to specific groups of pods. There are different types:

- **NodePort**: Primarily used in development environments, exposes a specific port on each worker node to allow external communication to pods. Not recommended for production environments.

- **ClusterIP**: Allows internal communication within the cluster through a specific IP. Facilitates load balancing between pods associated with the same application.

- **LoadBalancer**: When working with Kubernetes in the cloud, this type of service automatically creates a load balancer in the cloud service provider, ensuring more scalable and resilient traffic.

- **ExternalName**: Highly recommended for production environments, allows mapping a public name (like an RDS database in AWS) to a private name within the cluster. Optimizes communication times between internal and external services.

## How Does an Application Flow Work in Kubernetes? 🔄

Deploying an application in Kubernetes follows a well-defined process:

1. **Pod Deployment** 🎭: A pod is deployed within a specific namespace
2. **Scheduler Decision** 📅: The scheduler determines which worker node to place it on
3. **Container Startup** 🚀: The kubelet on that node starts the corresponding container
4. **Network Layer** 🌐: The kube-proxy establishes the network layer to allow communications
5. **Service Routing** 🔄: Services (like an Ingress or load balancer) redirect HTTP requests from the internet to the correct pods

This complete process allows Kubernetes to act as a true orchestra conductor, coordinating all elements so that our application functions optimally, scalably, and resilient to failures. 🎼

## Conclusion 🎉

Kubernetes architecture represents an elegant solution to modern computing challenges, enabling resilient and scalable deployments regardless of application complexity. The combination of master and worker nodes, along with the sophisticated control plane components, creates a robust foundation for container orchestration that can handle everything from simple applications to complex microservices architectures. 🌟

# Introduction to Kubernetes API and Kubectl 🎮

## Summary 📋

How to configure and start working with Kubernetes using MiniKube? Knowing how to configure and manage Kubernetes efficiently is fundamental for any professional in the DevOps or systems administration area. With a cluster configured with MiniKube, we can begin exploring Kubernetes capabilities. Below, we offer you a step-by-step guide based on best practices so you can make the most of the tools at your disposal. 🛠️

For additional comprehensive notes and resources, check out the [Kubernetes Introduction Notes](https://memoescalona.notion.site/Kubernetes-Introducci-n-1b44fd7dd88780e89717f2ac4835ff5f).

## What is the First Step to Start with MiniKube and Kubernetes? 🚀

First, you must have the local cluster configured with MiniKube. This is an essential tool that allows you to manage your cluster locally, offering a flexible platform for different configurations, such as working with multiple nodes or different versions of Kubernetes. To start the cluster, we use the command:

```bash
minikube start --driver=docker
```

This command, in addition to lifting the cluster, can be complemented with various specific parameters according to your needs, such as the driver you prefer to use. ⚙️

## What is KubeCTL and How Do We Interact with Kubernetes? 🎮

KubeCTL is the essential bridge to your Kubernetes cluster's API server. Through it, we can make a variety of requests such as create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) resources. A basic example to query resources is the command:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

With this, we can list the active pods in our current namespace. However, to get more details, we can use:

```bash
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

## What are Namespaces and How to Manage Them? 🏷️

Namespaces are crucial for organizing and logically separating resources within Kubernetes. By default, the cluster has a "default" namespace, but you can create and delete additional ones as needed:

### Create a new namespace:

```bash
kubectl create namespace k8s-demo
```

### Validate namespace creation:

```bash
kubectl get namespaces
```

### Delete a namespace:

```bash
kubectl delete namespace k8s-demo
```

## How Do We Manage Nodes Within Kubernetes? 🖥️

An important aspect of Kubernetes is managing the nodes that make up the cluster, where we perform operations with:

### List nodes:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

### Describe a node:

```bash
kubectl describe node
```

These commands provide valuable information about the node's role, status, and resources.

## How Are Declarative and Imperative Operator Configurations Applied? ⚙️

Kubernetes allows two styles for managing configurations:

- **Declarative**: Uses YAML files to define the desired state of the system.
- **Imperative**: Executes commands directly to carry out a specific action.

To apply a pod using a YAML file imperatively, we use:

```bash
kubectl apply -f simple-pod.yaml
```

And to delete that pod if it's no longer needed:

```bash
kubectl delete pod <pod-name>
```

## How to Keep Our Cluster in Top Shape with MiniKube? 🔧

To customize our cluster and expand its functionalities, MiniKube offers various add-ons. Some essential ones for improving management are:

### Metric Server: 
For obtaining cluster metrics and auto-scaling possibilities.

```bash
minikube addons enable metrics-server
```

### Registry: 
Links the Docker registry with MiniKube.

```bash
minikube addons enable registry
```

These components are critical for efficient handling and smooth development within Kubernetes.

## Essential Kubectl Commands Cheat Sheet 📝

Here are some essential commands to get you started:

### Basic Resource Management:
```bash
# Get all pods
kubectl get pods

# Get all services
kubectl get services

# Get all deployments
kubectl get deployments

# Get detailed information about a pod
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>

# Get logs from a pod
kubectl logs <pod-name>
```

### Context and Configuration:
```bash
# Get current context
kubectl config current-context

# List all contexts
kubectl config get-contexts

# Switch context
kubectl config use-context <context-name>
```

### Resource Creation and Management:
```bash
# Create a resource from a file
kubectl apply -f <filename.yaml>

# Delete a resource
kubectl delete <resource-type> <resource-name>

# Edit a resource
kubectl edit <resource-type> <resource-name>
```

## Conclusion 🎉

Now that we've explored the basics for interacting with and managing Kubernetes with MiniKube and KubeCTL, it's time to learn how to deploy complex applications. The combination of declarative and imperative approaches, along with proper namespace management and add-on configuration, provides a solid foundation for Kubernetes operations. 

Continue exploring and learn more about deploying frontend and backend applications with Kubernetes! The journey to becoming a Kubernetes expert continues with hands-on practice and real-world application deployment. 🌟

# Differences Between Declarative and Imperative Approaches 🎯

## Summary 📋

Using Kubernetes in professional environments requires understanding its two fundamental working approaches: imperative and declarative. Both methodologies have specific purposes that developers and systems administrators must master to efficiently manage their clusters. Knowing when and how to use each approach can make the difference between a successful implementation and problems in production. 🎯

## What is the Difference Between Imperative and Declarative Approaches in Kubernetes? 🤔

Resource management in Kubernetes can be performed following two distinct philosophies, each with particular characteristics that determine their suitability according to the context of use.

## Imperative Approach: Direct and Precise Commands 🎮

The imperative approach in Kubernetes is based on giving direct instructions to the cluster through specific commands. It's like an orchestra conductor giving clear and concise instructions to the musicians:

```bash
kubectl run mypod --image nginx
```

With this command, we are explicitly telling Kubernetes to create a pod called "mypod" using the nginx image. The execution of this command generates an immediate response:

```
pod/mypod created
```

To verify that the pod has been created correctly, we can use another imperative command:

```bash
kubectl get pod
```

And we'll get information about the created pod, including its status, runtime, and restarts. Similarly, we can delete the pod with:

```bash
kubectl delete pod mypod
```

### The imperative approach is ideal for:

- **Quick problem debugging** 🔍
- **Ephemeral testing** ⚡
- **Rapid validations in development environments** 🧪
- **Learning and familiarization with Kubernetes** 📚

However, it presents important limitations for production environments, mainly because it's difficult to maintain over time and doesn't provide a clear history of changes made.

## Declarative Approach: Definition of Desired States 📝

The declarative approach works differently: instead of indicating step by step what Kubernetes should do, we define the desired final state in YAML files. Following the musical analogy, this would be like providing a complete score to the orchestra:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
```

To apply this configuration, we use:

```bash
kubectl apply -f mypod.yaml
```

And to delete the resource:

```bash
kubectl delete -f mypod.yaml
```

### The declarative approach offers crucial advantages:

- **YAML files are versionable in systems like Git** 📂
- **Facilitate change auditing** 📝
- **Allow complete and complex resource definitions** 🏗️
- **Are readable and maintainable by diverse teams** 👥
- **Provide clear documentation of infrastructure** 📋

However, this approach has a steeper learning curve due to YAML syntax, which can be unintuitive at first.

## Why is it Important to Master Both Approaches in Kubernetes? 🎯

Understanding and managing both imperative and declarative approaches is fundamental for any professional working with Kubernetes:

The **imperative approach** allows quick interactions with the cluster, which is invaluable during development, testing, and troubleshooting. Imagine you need to quickly verify if a specific pod is working correctly; it would be cumbersome to create a YAML file for such a simple test.

The **declarative approach**, on the other hand, is crucial for production environments where consistency, reproducibility, and version control are essential. It allows defining complex resources with precision and maintaining a clear record of the desired configuration.

## Practical Cases for Each Approach 🔧

### Imperative Approach:

- **Real-time problem diagnosis** 🔍
- **Quick configuration testing** ⚡
- **Component functionality verification** ✅
- **Learning and experimentation environments** 🧪

### Declarative Approach:

- **Application deployment in production environments** 🚀
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** 🏗️
- **Complex configurations with multiple interrelated resources** 🔗
- **Long-term cluster resource management** 📈

## How to Implement Both Approaches in Real Applications? 🌟

In real-world applications, we rarely work with a single pod as in our example. Applications typically involve multiple components such as Deployments, ReplicaSets, Services, and other Kubernetes resources.

For proper scaling, it's recommended to:

1. **Use the imperative approach for initial testing and quick verifications** ⚡
2. **Transform those successful configurations into YAML files for declarative implementation** 📝
3. **Maintain these YAML files in version-controlled repositories** 📂
4. **Implement CI/CD processes that apply these files automatically** 🔄

The YAML format, although initially complex, is widely used in the DevOps and cloud ecosystem, including tools like GitHub Actions and Jenkins. Mastering this syntax will benefit not only your work with Kubernetes but also with other ecosystem tools.

## Comparison Table: Imperative vs Declarative 📊

| Aspect | Imperative Approach | Declarative Approach |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Syntax** | Command-line instructions | YAML/JSON files |
| **Learning Curve** | Easy to start | Steeper learning curve |
| **Version Control** | Difficult to track | Excellent with Git |
| **Reproducibility** | Manual steps required | Fully reproducible |
| **Production Ready** | Limited | Highly recommended |
| **Use Case** | Development/Testing | Production/CI-CD |
| **Maintenance** | Difficult over time | Easy to maintain |

## Best Practices for Each Approach 💡

### Imperative Best Practices:
- Use for quick testing and debugging
- Document commands for team reference
- Convert successful configurations to declarative format
- Use aliases for frequently used commands

### Declarative Best Practices:
- Use meaningful names and labels
- Implement proper resource limits and requests
- Use namespaces for organization
- Implement health checks and probes
- Use ConfigMaps and Secrets for configuration

## Conclusion 🎉

The effective combination of both approaches allows you to create scalable and robust applications in real environments. Practice is key to becoming familiar with YAML syntax and the different Kubernetes objects, which will eventually allow you to take full advantage of this powerful container orchestration platform.

The choice between imperative and declarative approaches depends on your specific use case, but mastering both will make you a more versatile and effective Kubernetes practitioner. Remember that the declarative approach is generally preferred for production environments, while the imperative approach excels in development and troubleshooting scenarios. 🌟

# Pods, ReplicaSets, and Deployments 📦

## Summary 📋

How to access resources in Kubernetes with Kubectl? When working with Kubernetes, the Kubectl command is our gateway to interact with resources. To begin, it's fundamental to see how to access pods and understand the core building blocks of Kubernetes applications. This class covers the essential concepts of Pods, ReplicaSets, and Deployments - the foundation of any Kubernetes application. 🎯

## How to Access Resources in Kubernetes with Kubectl? 🚀

When working with Kubernetes, the Kubectl command is our gateway to interact with resources. To begin, it's fundamental to see how to access pods:

### Get Pods: 
Execute `kubectl get pods`. If you don't specify a namespace, the default namespace will be used.

Now, what do we know about namespaces?

### Validate Namespaces: 
Use `kubectl get namespaces` to see existing namespaces, which include default, kube-node-lease, kube-public, and kube-system.

These namespaces, especially those starting with "kube", are for internal Kubernetes use. But if you want to create new namespaces:

### Create Namespace: 
Implement `create namespace` or its short form `create ns`.

## How to Manage Pods Efficiently? 🚀

When working with pods, two approaches are handled: imperative and declarative. These approaches offer different ways to create and manage pods, and we want to share some examples.

### Imperative Approach with Kubectl 🚀

To illustrate pod creation in an imperative way, we'll use CLI (Command Line Interface) commands:

```bash
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx --restart=Never --port=80
```

When executing this, Kubernetes assumes several default parameters, such as IP address and container ID. Subsequently, we validate with:

### Describe a Pod: 
`kubectl describe pod <pod-name>`. Here you'll see conditions and states of the pod.

### Declarative Approach with YAML Files 📝

Kubernetes can also be managed declaratively with YAML files that detail specific configurations. These files are especially useful for automation and infrastructure as code management.

## How to Scale Applications with ReplicaSets? 📈

As you try to scale applications, ReplicaSets come into play. These are responsible for managing multiple instances of pods.

### Creating a ReplicaSet 🏗️

To create a ReplicaSet, use a YAML file with the following structure:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: example-replicaset
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

Implement with:

```bash
kubectl apply -f replicasets.yaml
```

### Verification and Maintenance 🔧

- **Observe ReplicaSets**: `kubectl get replicasets`
- **Delete a Pod**: When you delete it, the ReplicaSet automatically creates a new one to maintain the desired number of replicas

## What Role Do Deployments Play in Kubernetes? 🚀

Deployments act as the top layer, managing ReplicaSets and facilitating control over applications.

### Benefits of a Deployment 🎯

A deployment allows:

- **Continuous updates**: Implement new versions without interrupting service
- **Automatic rollback**: Revert failed updates
- **Rolling updates**: Update pods gradually without downtime
- **Version control**: Track different versions of your application

### Creating a Deployment 🏗️

Use the following YAML:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: example-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 4
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: hello-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: hello-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: hello-app
        image: google-samples/hello-app:1.0
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```

Implement with:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

### Image Updates 🔄

To update the image to a newer version, use:

```bash
kubectl set image deployment/example-deployment hello-app=google-samples/hello-app:2.0
```

### Validation and Monitoring 📊

- **View counters in deployments and ReplicaSets**: `kubectl get deployments` and `kubectl get replicasets`
- **Undo updates**: `kubectl rollout undo deployment/example-deployment`
- **Check rollout status**: `kubectl rollout status deployment/example-deployment`
- **View rollout history**: `kubectl rollout history deployment/example-deployment`

## How to Expose Traffic to Kubernetes? 🔄

To manage traffic between our local machine and pods, port-forward commands are used:

```bash
kubectl port-forward deployment/example-deployment 8080:8080
```

This redirects traffic to port 8080 of the deployment, allowing you to verify in the browser with localhost:8080.

## Understanding the Hierarchy: Pods → ReplicaSets → Deployments 📊

### Pods (The Basic Unit) 📦
- **What they are**: The smallest deployable units in Kubernetes
- **Purpose**: Run one or more containers
- **Lifecycle**: Can be created, updated, and deleted
- **Direct management**: Not recommended for production

### ReplicaSets (Ensuring Availability) 🔄
- **What they are**: Ensures a specified number of pod replicas are running
- **Purpose**: Maintain pod availability and scaling
- **Self-healing**: Automatically replaces failed pods
- **Scaling**: Can scale up or down based on demand

### Deployments (Production-Ready Management) 🚀
- **What they are**: Higher-level abstraction that manages ReplicaSets
- **Purpose**: Provide declarative updates for pods and ReplicaSets
- **Rolling updates**: Update applications without downtime
- **Rollback capability**: Revert to previous versions if needed

## Practical Examples and Commands 📝

### Working with Pods:
```bash
# Create a simple pod
kubectl run my-pod --image=nginx

# Get pod details
kubectl describe pod my-pod

# Get pod logs
kubectl logs my-pod

# Delete a pod
kubectl delete pod my-pod
```

### Working with ReplicaSets:
```bash
# Create ReplicaSet from file
kubectl apply -f replicaset.yaml

# Scale ReplicaSet
kubectl scale replicaset example-replicaset --replicas=5

# Get ReplicaSet details
kubectl describe replicaset example-replicaset
```

### Working with Deployments:
```bash
# Create deployment from file
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml

# Scale deployment
kubectl scale deployment example-deployment --replicas=6

# Update deployment image
kubectl set image deployment/example-deployment container-name=new-image:tag

# Rollback deployment
kubectl rollout undo deployment/example-deployment

# Check deployment status
kubectl rollout status deployment/example-deployment
```

## Best Practices 💡

### For Pods:
- Don't create pods directly in production
- Use Deployments instead
- Always specify resource limits and requests
- Use health checks (liveness and readiness probes)

### For ReplicaSets:
- Use Deployments instead of managing ReplicaSets directly
- ReplicaSets are managed automatically by Deployments
- Focus on the desired state rather than manual scaling

### For Deployments:
- Use meaningful names and labels
- Implement proper resource limits
- Use rolling update strategy
- Monitor rollout status
- Keep deployment history for rollbacks

## Conclusion 🎉

I invite everyone to share what they think about this Kubernetes workflow and how they could incorporate it into their future projects. These concepts are just the beginning for mastering application deployment and management in the cloud.

The combination of Pods, ReplicaSets, and Deployments provides a robust foundation for running applications in Kubernetes. Understanding how these components work together is essential for building scalable, reliable, and maintainable applications in the cloud. 🌟

Remember:
- **Pods** are the basic building blocks
- **ReplicaSets** ensure availability and scaling
- **Deployments** provide production-ready management with rolling updates and rollbacks

Continue exploring and practicing with these concepts to build your confidence in managing Kubernetes applications! 🚀

# Services and Ingress: Exposing Applications 🌐

## Summary 📋

The ability to expose applications to the outside world is fundamental in Kubernetes environments. Among the various available options, Ingress stands out for offering an additional layer of customization that goes beyond traditional services. Understanding the differences between these exposure mechanisms allows developers and systems administrators to choose the most suitable solution for each scenario. 🎯

## What Options Do We Have for Exposing Services in Kubernetes? 🔗

Before diving into Ingress, it's important to review the different types of services that Kubernetes offers for exposing applications:

### NodePort 
Exposes a specific port on each of the Kubernetes cluster nodes. This allows accepting traffic from the Internet or from within the cluster to a group of pods, simply by specifying the IP address and the configured port.

### ClusterIP 🏠
Assigns each service an IP within the cluster CIDR range. This type facilitates communication between different pods in the same namespace, different namespaces, or even different hosts, which is essential for applications exposed to the real world or microservices that need to communicate internally.

### LoadBalancer ⚖️
When working with a Kubernetes cluster in AWS, this type of service is automatically managed by AWS's network layer.

### ExternalName 🔗
Similar to CNAME records in DNS, acts as a wrapper for a well-constructed address (like a database address in AWS). These services allow adding caching and name resolution capabilities that optimize traffic from within the cluster to external services.

## What is Ingress and How Does It Differ from Other Services? 🚪

Ingress goes beyond the services mentioned above and provides advanced capabilities for exposing applications:

- **Allows load balancing** ⚖️
- **Offers SSL termination validation** 🔒
- **Facilitates virtual hosting management through paths and subpaths on registered hosts** 🌐

A typical use case would be a client wanting to access an application called "myapp.com". With Ingress, we can configure different routes:

- `api.myapp.com/login` that directs the user to backend services
- `myapp.com/dashboard` that leads to frontend services with user interfaces

This logical separation through domain names and paths makes applications much more accessible to end users.

## How to Implement an Ingress Controller in a Local Cluster? 🛠️

In Kubernetes, Ingress is highly customizable and there are different types of Ingress Controllers such as Nginx, Traefik, and HAProxy. In a local development environment with Minikube, we can implement it as follows:

### First, enable the Ingress addon in Minikube:
```bash
minikube addons enable ingress
```

### Verify that the Ingress Controller is working:
```bash
kubectl get pods -n ingress-nginx
```

### Deploy a sample application:
```bash
kubectl create deployment web --image=gcr.io/google-samples/hello-app:1.0
```

### Expose the application as a NodePort service:
```bash
kubectl expose deployment web --type=NodePort --port=8080
```

### Verify that the service is created correctly:
```bash
kubectl get service
```

### To access the application through NodePort in Minikube:
```bash
minikube service web --url
```

## How to Configure an Ingress for Our Application? ⚙️

To create an Ingress that points to our service, we need to define an Ingress resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: example-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - host: helloworld.example
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: web
            port:
              number: 8080
```

After applying this configuration with `kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml`, we can verify the Ingress status:

```bash
kubectl get ingress
kubectl describe ingress example-ingress
```

### DNS Resolution Configuration 🌐

For the Ingress to work correctly in a local environment, we must configure DNS resolution by editing the system's hosts file (`/etc/hosts` on macOS and Linux). We add an entry that points to our local IP:

```bash
127.0.0.1 helloworld.example
```

**Note for WSL Users**: If you're using WSL and having trouble visualizing in the browser, I also recommend adding `127.0.0.1 helloworld.example` to `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`.

### Enable Minikube Tunnel 🚇

Finally, we enable the Minikube tunnel to expose the Ingress:

```bash
minikube tunnel
```

Now we can access our application using the configured domain: `http://helloworld.example`

## What Advantages Does Ingress Offer in Production Environments? 🏭

In production environments, Ingress offers significant advantages:

- **Centralized route management**: Allows managing multiple services from a single entry point
- **TLS/SSL termination**: Facilitates SSL certificate configuration without needing to configure them on each service
- **Content-based routing**: Possibility to route traffic based on hosts, paths, or even headers
- **Cloud provider integration**: Major cloud providers offer optimized Ingress Controller implementations

## Service Types Comparison Table 📊

| Service Type | Use Case | External Access | Load Balancing | SSL/TLS |
|--------------|----------|-----------------|----------------|---------|
| **ClusterIP** | Internal communication | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| **NodePort** | Development/Testing | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| **LoadBalancer** | Production (Cloud) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **ExternalName** | External services | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Ingress** | Production (Advanced) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Practical Examples and Commands 📝

```

### Port Forwarding for Testing:

```bash
# Forward port to service
kubectl port-forward service/web 8080:8080

# Forward port to pod
kubectl port-forward pod/web-pod 8080:8080

# Forward port to deployment
kubectl port-forward deployment/web 8080:8080
```

## Best Practices 💡

### For Services:
- Use ClusterIP for internal communication
- Use NodePort only for development/testing
- Use LoadBalancer for production cloud environments
- Always specify resource limits and requests
- Use meaningful service names and labels

### For Ingress:
- Use meaningful hostnames and paths
- Implement proper SSL/TLS certificates
- Use annotations for controller-specific configurations
- Monitor Ingress controller performance
- Implement proper security policies

### Security Considerations 🔒:
- Use Network Policies to restrict traffic
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Use HTTPS in production environments
- Regularly update Ingress controllers
- Monitor for security vulnerabilities

## Troubleshooting Common Issues 🔧

### Service Not Accessible:
```bash
# Check service status
kubectl get services

# Check endpoints
kubectl get endpoints

# Check pod labels
kubectl get pods --show-labels
```

### Ingress Not Working:
```bash
# Check Ingress controller status
kubectl get pods -n ingress-nginx

# Check Ingress configuration
kubectl describe ingress <ingress-name>

# Check DNS resolution
nslookup <hostname>
```

## Conclusion 🎉

Ingress represents a powerful abstraction layer that simplifies traffic management in Kubernetes clusters, providing a more user-friendly experience for both developers and end users. Its flexibility allows it to be adapted to various scenarios, from local development environments to complex cloud infrastructures.

The combination of Services and Ingress provides a comprehensive solution for exposing applications in Kubernetes, from simple internal communication to complex production deployments with advanced routing and security features. 🌟

I invite you to experiment by creating your own deployment with a different name and configuring a custom Ingress for it. Share your results and learnings in the comments section! 🚀

Remember that mastering Services and Ingress is essential for building production-ready applications in Kubernetes, as they form the foundation of how your applications communicate with the outside world. 🌐

# ConfigMaps and Secrets: Configuration and Sensitive Data 🔐

## Summary 📋

ConfigMaps and Secrets are fundamental for protecting your application configuration in Kubernetes. Not implementing them properly could expose sensitive information and compromise the security of your deployments. These two resources allow you to separate configuration from code, following modern development best practices, and add additional security layers that every systems administrator should know. 🛡️

## What are ConfigMaps and Secrets in Kubernetes? 🤔

ConfigMaps and Secrets are Kubernetes objects that allow storing configuration information separate from the application code. However, they have different purposes and distinct security levels.

**ConfigMaps** are designed to store non-sensitive configuration data in key-value pair format. This data is stored in plain text and is easily accessible. On the other hand, **Secrets** are specifically designed to store confidential information such as passwords, OAuth tokens, SSH keys, and other sensitive data that should not be exposed. 🔒

To experiment with these objects, we can use the files provided in the `08-configs-secrets` folder of our project:

- A file to create a ConfigMap
- A file to create a Secret
- A README.md file with instructions and commands

## How to Create and Manage ConfigMaps? 📝

To create a ConfigMap declaratively, first we need to review the file structure. In the `autconfig.yaml` example, we find:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: autconfig
data:
  api_url: "https://api.example.com"
```

This file defines an object of type ConfigMap called "autconfig" that contains a URL as configuration data. To apply it in our cluster, we execute:

```bash
kubectl apply -f autconfig.yaml
```

Once created, we can verify its existence and content with the following commands:

```bash
kubectl get configmap
kubectl describe configmap autconfig
```

The `describe` command will show us the value in plain text, confirming that ConfigMaps store information without encryption. This is suitable for values such as:

- **Execution environments** (development, staging, production) ��️
- **Non-sensitive external service URLs** ��
- **Log levels** (debug, info, error) 📊

A good exercise is to create a ConfigMap with different types of variables like strings, integers, or other types to configure your application.

## How to Implement Secrets for Sensitive Information? ��

Unlike ConfigMaps, Secrets add an additional security layer by encoding values in base64. To create a Secret imperatively from the command line:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic autsecret --from-literal=client_id=myclientid --from-literal=client_secret=secret
```

This command creates a Secret called "autsecret" with two values: `client_id` and `client_secret`. Although we pass these values in plain text from the console (which is not a good practice in production), Kubernetes will store them encoded.

To verify the Secret creation:

```bash
kubectl get secret
kubectl describe secret autsecret
```

The `describe` command will show that we have "Opaque" type information and will indicate the size in bytes of each value, but will not directly show the data. To view or edit these values:

```bash
kubectl edit secret autsecret
```

This command will open an editor where we'll see the base64 encoded values. If we need to decode these values, we can use online tools or the `base64` command in the terminal.

It's important to note that although Secrets encode data in base64, this doesn't provide real encryption, only obfuscation. For environments with higher security requirements, it's recommended to consider solutions such as:

- **HashiCorp Vault** 🏦
- **External Secrets with AWS Secrets Manager** ☁️

## Best Practices for Configuration and Secrets Management 💡

Proper implementation of ConfigMaps and Secrets offers several benefits for your application architecture and security:

### Configuration Decoupling 🔗
Allows completely separating configuration from application code, facilitating maintenance and changes.

### Multi-Environment Support 🌍
You can create different ConfigMaps for each environment (development, testing, production) without changing the code.

### Secret Rotation 🔄
Secrets can be updated and rotated regularly without needing to rebuild and redeploy applications.

### Granular Access Control 🔐
Kubernetes allows defining access policies to determine which users or applications can access which secrets.

### External Solution Integration 🔗
For greater security, you can integrate solutions like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager through External Secrets.

## When to Use Each Type of Object? 🎯

### ConfigMaps: For non-sensitive configuration data that can be in plain text
- **Environment variables** 🌍
- **Non-confidential URLs** 🌐
- **Logging configuration** 📊
- **Application parameters** ⚙️

### Secrets: Exclusively for sensitive information
- **API keys** ��
- **Passwords** ��
- **Authentication tokens** 🎫
- **SSL certificates** 📜

## Practical Examples and Commands 📝

### Creating ConfigMaps:

```bash
# From file
kubectl apply -f configmap.yaml

# From literal values
kubectl create configmap my-config --from-literal=key1=value1 --from-literal=key2=value2

# From file content
kubectl create configmap my-config --from-file=config.properties

# From directory
kubectl create configmap my-config --from-file=./config/
```

### Creating Secrets:

```bash
# From literal values
kubectl create secret generic my-secret --from-literal=username=admin --from-literal=password=secret123

# From file
kubectl create secret generic my-secret --from-file=./secrets/

# From file content
kubectl create secret generic my-secret --from-file=username=./username.txt --from-file=password=./password.txt
```

### Managing ConfigMaps and Secrets:

```bash
# List all ConfigMaps
kubectl get configmaps

# List all Secrets
kubectl get secrets

# Describe ConfigMap
kubectl describe configmap my-config

# Describe Secret
kubectl describe secret my-secret

# Edit ConfigMap
kubectl edit configmap my-config

# Edit Secret
kubectl edit secret my-secret

# Delete ConfigMap
kubectl delete configmap my-config

# Delete Secret
kubectl delete secret my-secret
```

## Security Considerations 🔒

### ConfigMaps Security:
- ✅ Suitable for non-sensitive data
- ❌ Not encrypted (stored in plain text)
- ⚠️ Don't store passwords, keys, or tokens
- 📝 Use for configuration parameters, URLs, environment names

### Secrets Security:
- ✅ Base64 encoded (not encrypted)
- ⚠️ Not suitable for highly sensitive data in production
- 🔐 Consider external secret management solutions
- 🔄 Implement regular secret rotation

## Advanced Secret Management Solutions 🚀

### HashiCorp Vault:
```bash
# Install Vault
helm repo add hashicorp https://helm.releases.hashicorp.com
helm install vault hashicorp/vault

# Configure External Secrets Operator
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/external-secrets/external-secrets/main/config/samples/secretstore.yaml
```

### AWS Secrets Manager:
```yaml
apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1beta1
kind: SecretStore
metadata:
  name: aws-secret-store
spec:
  provider:
    aws:
      service: SecretsManager
      region: us-west-2
```

## Using ConfigMaps and Secrets in Pods 🐳

### As Environment Variables:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: nginx

    - name: PASSWORD
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: my-secret
          key: password
```

### As Volumes:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: nginx
    volumeMounts:
    - name: config-volume
      mountPath: /etc/config
    - name: secret-volume
      mountPath: /etc/secrets
  volumes:
  - name: config-volume
    configMap:
      name: my-config
  - name: secret-volume
    secret:
      secretName: my-secret
```

## Best Practices Summary ��

### Do's ✅:
- Use ConfigMaps for non-sensitive configuration
- Use Secrets for sensitive data
- Implement proper RBAC for access control
- Use external secret management for production
- Regularly rotate secrets
- Use meaningful names and labels

### Don'ts ❌:
- Store sensitive data in ConfigMaps
- Commit secrets to version control
- Use base64 encoding as real encryption
- Share secrets across namespaces unnecessarily
- Use default service accounts for secret access

## Conclusion 🎉

The next step in our learning will be discovering how to integrate these ConfigMaps and Secrets with our Pods and Deployments so that our applications can use these configurations. This involves understanding how to mount these resources as environment variables or as volumes within containers.

Proper management of configurations and secrets is fundamental for maintaining secure and easily maintainable applications in Kubernetes. We encourage you to experiment by creating your own ConfigMaps and Secrets, integrating them into your applications, and exploring more advanced solutions for production environments with high security requirements. 🌟

Remember that security is not just about protecting data, but also about implementing proper practices and using the right tools for each scenario. Start with ConfigMaps and Secrets, then evolve to more sophisticated solutions as your security requirements grow! 🔐

# Kubernetes Network Model: Pods and Services 🌐

## Summary 📋

The Kubernetes network represents one of the most sophisticated components of its architecture, allowing pods and services to communicate seamlessly regardless of where they are physically hosted. This transparent communication capability is fundamental for building robust and scalable distributed applications, and understanding how this network model works helps us solve problems and optimize our implementations. 🎯

## How Does the Network Model Work in Kubernetes? ⚙️

The Kubernetes network model is based on an apparently simple but technically complex concept: **flat networking between pods**. This feature allows each pod to communicate directly with any other pod in the cluster, even if they are on different nodes or workers.

This design is based on three main rules:

### 1. Direct Node Communication 🔗
All nodes must be able to connect to each other without needing Network Address Translation (NAT). This means that workers or nodes are on the same network and have direct communication between them.

### 2. Direct Pod Communication ��
Communication must be direct between pods. This transparency allows a pod in one namespace (for example, frontend) to communicate with another pod in a different namespace (like backend) using simply IP addresses or service names.

### 3. Shared Network Segment 🌐
Pods and services share the same network segment. This configuration facilitates communication between services and the groups of pods associated with deployments or other Kubernetes objects.

## Key Components of Networking in Kubernetes 🏗️

The Kubernetes network works thanks to several components that work coordinately:

### Container Network Interface (CNI) 🔌
It's an interface that allows using different plugins to manage the network. Among the most popular options stand out:

- **Calico** 🦔: Highly recommended in the community for its ease of learning and adaptability to multiple use cases.
- **Flannel** 🧶: Offers similar capabilities for network configuration, although it presents some limitations in security aspects.

### kube-proxy 🌐
This component, which we've talked about previously, uses IPTables (Linux mechanism) for request routing. When someone tries to access a pod, kube-proxy:

1. **Receives the request** 📥
2. **Redirects it to the appropriate pods of the service** 🔄
3. **Updates routes in IPTables when there are changes** ��

### CoreDNS ��
It's the component responsible for service discovery, allowing the use of service names to reference specific groups of pods or services within the cluster.

## The OSI and TCP/IP Model in Kubernetes 📊

From a technical perspective, Kubernetes uses the practical TCP/IP model (based on the theoretical OSI model):

- **Pods communicate using layer 3 (network)**, employing routing and IP protocol.
- **Services use upper layer protocols (application and transport)**, taking advantage of TCP, UDP, and load balancing mechanisms.

## Why is the Network Model Important in Kubernetes? ��

The sophisticated Kubernetes network model is what allows our distributed applications to work in a coordinated manner. A Kubernetes cluster can run in various environments:

- **In the cloud** ☁️
- **In on-premise environments** 🏢
- **In virtual machines within the same host** 💻

In all these cases, the Kubernetes network ensures that components can communicate properly, maintaining the availability, fault tolerance, and resilience of our applications.

## Service Discovery and Its Importance 🔍

CoreDNS plays a fundamental role in the Kubernetes architecture, handling service discovery between services and associated pod groups. This allows any component to be reached both internally and externally, without worrying about knowing the exact IP addresses of each element.

## Network Architecture Deep Dive 🏛️

### Pod Network Model ��
```yaml
# Example: Pod with network configuration
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
      protocol: TCP
```

### Service Network Model ��
```yaml
# Example: Service exposing pods
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: example-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
  type: ClusterIP
```

## Network Policies and Security 🔒

### Network Policy Example:
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: default-deny
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
```

### Allowing Specific Traffic:
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-web-traffic
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: web
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: frontend
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
```

## Practical Network Commands and Tools 🛠️

### Network Troubleshooting Commands:
```bash
# Check pod network connectivity
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- ping <target-pod-ip>

# Check service endpoints
kubectl get endpoints <service-name>

# Check network policies
kubectl get networkpolicies

# Check DNS resolution
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- nslookup <service-name>

# Check pod network configuration
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
```

### Network Debugging Tools:
```bash
# Install network debugging tools in a pod
kubectl run debug-pod --image=nicolaka/netshoot --rm -it

# Check network interfaces
kubectl exec -it debug-pod -- ip addr

# Check routing table
kubectl exec -it debug-pod -- ip route

# Check DNS configuration
kubectl exec -it debug-pod -- cat /etc/resolv.conf
```

## Network Performance and Optimization 📈

### Best Practices for Network Performance:
- **Use appropriate CNI plugins** for your use case
- **Implement network policies** for security
- **Monitor network metrics** regularly
- **Optimize service mesh** configurations if using Istio/Linkerd
- **Use appropriate service types** (ClusterIP vs NodePort vs LoadBalancer)

### Network Monitoring:
```bash
# Check network metrics
kubectl top pods

# Monitor network policies
kubectl get networkpolicies --all-namespaces

# Check service endpoints
kubectl get endpoints --all-namespaces
```

## Common Network Issues and Solutions ��

```bash
# Check if pods are in the same namespace
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces

# Verify service configuration
kubectl describe service <service-name>

# Check network policies
kubectl get networkpolicies
```

### Issue 2: DNS Resolution Problems
```bash
# Check CoreDNS pods
kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-dns

# Check CoreDNS logs
kubectl logs -n kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-dns

# Test DNS resolution
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- nslookup kubernetes.default
```

### Issue 3: Service Not Accessible
```bash
# Check service endpoints
kubectl get endpoints <service-name>

# Verify pod labels match service selector
kubectl get pods --show-labels
kubectl describe service <service-name>
```

## Network Security Considerations 🛡️

### Security Best Practices:
- **Implement network policies** to restrict traffic
- **Use service mesh** for advanced security features
- **Encrypt traffic** between services
- **Monitor network traffic** for anomalies
- **Regular security audits** of network configurations

### Network Policy Examples:
```yaml
# Deny all traffic by default
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: default-deny-all
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
```

## Advanced Networking Features 🚀

### Service Mesh Integration:
- **Istio**: Advanced traffic management and security

# Service Types: ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, and ExternalName 🌐

## Summary 📋

How to expose applications in Kubernetes? When working with Kubernetes, one of the most important challenges is learning how to expose our applications to the outside world. That is, enabling the connection of our applications deployed in a cluster with external users. In the Kubernetes ecosystem, there are four main components used for this task: NodePort, ClusterIP, LoadBalancer, and ExternalName. 🎯

## How to Expose Applications in Kubernetes? ��

When working with Kubernetes, one of the most important challenges is learning how to expose our applications to the outside world. That is, enabling the connection of our applications deployed in a cluster with external users. In the Kubernetes ecosystem, there are four main components used for this task: NodePort, ClusterIP, LoadBalancer, and ExternalName.

## What is a NodePort? 🚪

The NodePort concept is essential within Kubernetes. This type of service allows us to expose a pod on a specific port of each node in the cluster. It's notable that in more advanced scenarios, such as using MiniKube, you can create multi-node clusters.

To configure it, the first thing you must do is define this service in a YAML file. A basic example includes the following elements:

- **Metadata** to relate the service with a ReplicaSet, Deployment, or Pod
- **containerPort** that the deployment uses (e.g., 8080)
- **nodePort** that allows connecting external traffic to the pod

Here's how a configuration file would look:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: hello-nodeport
spec:
  selector:
    app: HelloNodePort
  type: NodePort
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
      nodePort: 30007
```

To implement this service, use the command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment-nodeport.yaml
```

### NodePort Use Cases 🎯
- **Development and testing environments** 🧪
- **Local cluster access** 💻
- **Quick application exposure** ⚡
- **Multi-node cluster scenarios** 🔗

## What is ClusterIP Used For? 🏠

The ClusterIP service type is used when you want to expose applications within the same cluster. This functionality is ideal when several microservices or applications need to communicate with each other within the cluster.

The configuration is quite similar to NodePort, but focused on internal connectivity. Here, the service takes a specific IP address from the CIDR range assigned to the cluster.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: hello-cluster-ip
spec:
  selector:
    app: HelloClusterIP
  type: ClusterIP
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
```

To deploy this service, use:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment-clusterip.yaml
```

### ClusterIP Use Cases ��
- **Internal microservice communication** 🔄
- **Database access within cluster** 💾
- **API gateway internal routing** 🚪
- **Service-to-service communication** 🤝

## How is a LoadBalancer Managed? ⚖️

This is the appropriate service when working in cloud environments such as AWS, GCP, or Azure. When a LoadBalancer type service is detected, the cloud provider automatically deploys an instance that will manage the traffic.

Here's an example configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: hello-loadbalancer
spec:
  selector:
    app: HelloLoadBalancer
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
```

The command to apply it is:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment-loadbalancer.yaml
```

### LoadBalancer Use Cases 🎯
- **Production cloud environments** ☁️
- **High availability applications** 🛡️
- **Auto-scaling scenarios** 📈
- **Multi-region deployments** 🌍

## What is an ExternalName and When to Use It? 🔗

The ExternalName service is very useful for connecting Kubernetes with third-party resources, such as external databases. Unlike the previous types, ExternalName doesn't manage direct pods, but rather encapsulates the URL of the external resource, facilitating its use and refactoring in large applications.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-database-service
spec:
  type: ExternalName
  externalName: database.example.com
```

To create this resource, simply execute:

```bash
kubectl apply -f externalname.yaml
```

### ExternalName Use Cases 🎯
- **External database connections** 💾

# Persistent Volumes (PV) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVC) 💾

## Summary 📋

Persistent storage in Kubernetes is fundamental for preserving critical data in production and development scenarios. When working with applications that require maintaining information, it's essential to implement properly configured persistent volumes. The concepts of PV (Persistent Volume) and PVC (Persistent Volume Claim) are essential to ensure that our applications maintain data integrity even when pods restart or are deleted. ��️

## Why is it Crucial to Implement Persistent Storage in Kubernetes? 🎯

When we run applications in Kubernetes without properly configuring persistent storage through PV and PVC, we risk losing all our data. This is especially critical in production environments where data loss can have devastating consequences.

While it's true that in production environments it's not recommended to manage databases directly in Kubernetes (preferring managed services like AWS RDS), in development environments implementing databases within the cluster can generate significant savings. This avoids maintaining external services like RDS, RabbitMQ, or other storage services that generate constant costs, especially when not used continuously during development.

## Differences Between Stateless and Stateful Applications 🔄

Before diving into PV and PVC, it's important to understand two fundamental concepts in application design:

### Stateless (No State) 📤
Each request is independent and contains all the necessary information to be processed. It doesn't require accessing previously stored data to resolve the request. A typical example is a REST API where each request includes in the body all the data necessary to generate a response.

### Stateful (With State) ��
These applications require accessing persistent data to process requests. When a request with limited information is received, the backend must query a database or other storage system to obtain additional information and generate an appropriate response.

The main difference between both approaches lies in the need to access persistent data, and it's here where the concepts of PV and PVC become vitally important in the Kubernetes context.

## How Do PV and PVC Work in Kubernetes? ��

We can understand PV and PVC through a simple metaphor: a data warehouse and a key to access it.

### Persistent Volume (PV) 🏢
Represents the physical data warehouse, the volume where our information is located.

### Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) 🔑
Acts as the key that allows pods to access the data warehouse. It's a storage request made by a pod.

This architecture offers an abstraction layer that allows developers not to worry about the specific details of the underlying storage, focusing solely on requesting the space they need through PVCs.

## Storage Types (Storage Classes) ��

Kubernetes offers different storage classes:

### Manual Storage Class ��️
Used primarily in local environments, referencing directories within the local machine.

### AWS Services ☁️
Such as EFS (Elastic File System) or EBS (Elastic Block Storage), which provide greater efficiency, high availability, and facilitate data backups and migrations.

The relationship between these components follows a specific flow: a pod references a PVC, and this PVC links to a specific PV, all defined in the corresponding YAML files.

## How to Implement PV and PVC in a Development Environment? ��️

Let's go through a practical example using MiniKube as a local environment:

### Step 1: Prepare Data on the Host ��️
First, we need to create a file on the host that will be exposed to our pod:

```bash
sudo su
cd /mnt/data
echo "<h1>Hello from volume</h1>" > index.html
cat index.html
exit
```

### Step 2: Define the Persistent Volume (PV) 📄
We create a YAML file to define our PV:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: myPV
  labels:
    app: nginx-storage
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 1Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  storageClassName: manual
  hostPath:
    path: /mnt/data
```

In this definition:
- We specify a capacity of 1GB
- Configure the access mode as ReadWriteOnce (only one pod can mount it)
- Define the storage class as manual (for local environments)
- Point to the `/mnt/data` directory where we created our HTML file

### Step 3: Define the Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) 📋
Now we create the PVC that will claim the previous PV:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: myPVC
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx-storage
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
  storageClassName: manual
```

Note that the PVC uses a selector with matchLabels to specifically link to the PV we created, matching the "app: nginx-storage" label.

### Step 4: Create a Pod That Uses the PVC ��
Finally, we define a pod that uses our PVC:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myPod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: "/usr/share/nginx/html"
          name: myvolume
  volumes:
    - name: myvolume
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: myPVC
```

This pod:
- Uses the nginx image
- Mounts the volume in the default path where nginx looks for HTML files
- References the "myPVC" PVC we created earlier

### Step 5: Apply the Configurations ⚡
We apply the configurations in order:

```bash
kubectl apply -f pv-pvc.yaml
kubectl apply -f pod.yaml
```

### Step 6: Verify the Configuration ✅
We check that both PV and PVC are correctly established:

```bash
kubectl get pv,pvc
kubectl describe pod myPod
```

### Step 7: Validate the Functioning 🔍
To verify that everything works correctly:

```bash
kubectl exec myPod -- ls -la /usr/share/nginx/html
kubectl port-forward myPod 8080:80
```

Now we can access localhost:8080 in our browser and should see the message "Hello from volume".

## What are the Benefits of Using PV and PVC? 🎁

The implementation of persistent storage through PV and PVC offers multiple advantages:

### Data Persistence 💾
Information survives even if pods restart or are deleted.

### Storage Abstraction 🏗️
Developers don't need to know the details of storage implementation.

### Flexibility 🔄
Allows changing the underlying storage without modifying the application.

### Cost Savings 💰
Especially in development environments, avoids having to maintain expensive external services.

## Advanced PV and PVC Configurations 🚀

  throughput: "125"
```

### PVC with Storage Class:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: fast-storage-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  storageClassName: fast-ssd
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
```

        - name: www
          mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
  volumeClaimTemplates:
  - metadata:
      name: www
    spec:
      accessModes: [ "ReadWriteOnce" ]
      storageClassName: "fast-ssd"
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 1Gi
```

## Access Modes and Their Use Cases ��

# DaemonSets and StatefulSets: Specialized Workloads in Kubernetes 🚀

## Summary ��

Proper management of applications in production Kubernetes environments requires knowledge of specialized components like DaemonSets and StatefulSets. These objects offer specific solutions for different use cases, allowing the implementation of robust and scalable architectures. By mastering these concepts, you can optimize the deployment of applications that require high availability or data persistence. 🎯

## What are DaemonSets and StatefulSets in Kubernetes? 🤔

DaemonSets and StatefulSets are Kubernetes objects designed for specific use cases in production environments. Each has particular characteristics that make them suitable for different situations, especially when predictable behavior is required regarding pod execution and persistence.

### DaemonSet 🎯
A DaemonSet ensures that all nodes (or a specific set of nodes) run a copy of a pod. When nodes are added to the cluster, a DaemonSet pod is automatically added to them. The main characteristic is that each replica configured in a DaemonSet runs on one node at a time. This means that if we configure 3 or 4 replicas, we would need the same number of nodes.

### StatefulSet ��
On the other hand, a StatefulSet is designed for applications that require persistence and stable identifiers. Unlike regular Deployments, StatefulSets maintain a persistent identity for each pod, which is useful for stateful applications like databases.

## Understanding the 3 Types of Workloads ��

### 1. DEPLOYMENT 📌 For normal web applications
✅ **Use**: Stateless applications (APIs, websites)
✅ **Advantage**: Easy to scale and manage
❌ **Limitation**: Pods are interchangeable, lose data when restarting
💡 **Example**: A REST API that doesn't store important data

### 2. STATEFULSET 📌 For applications that NEED to store data
✅ **Use**: Databases, stateful applications
✅ **Advantage**: Each pod has its own permanent storage
✅ **Extra**: Each pod has a unique and stable DNS name (`<pod-name>.<service-name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local`)
�� **Example**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB

### 3. DAEMONSET 📌 For services that must be on ALL nodes
✅ **Use**: Monitoring, logging, system services
✅ **Advantage**: Runs automatically on each server in the cluster
✅ **Auto-scale**: If you add a server, it installs automatically
💡 **Example**: Monitoring agent like Prometheus

## How to Create a DaemonSet in Kubernetes? 🛠️

To create a DaemonSet, we need to define its specification in a YAML file. The structure is similar to other Kubernetes objects, with some particularities:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: nginx-daemonset
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginxApp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginxApp
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "64Mi"
            cpu: "250m"
          limits:
            memory: "128Mi"
            cpu: "500m"
```

In this example, we define a DaemonSet with a pod that runs Nginx. It's important to define the resources that our pods will use, as shown in the resources section. This establishes that the pod will initially be allocated 64Mi of memory and 250m of CPU, with limits of 128Mi and 500m respectively.

To create this DaemonSet, we execute:

```bash
kubectl apply -f daemonset.yaml
```

And we can verify its creation with:

```bash
kubectl get ds
```

## How to Implement StatefulSets with Persistent Storage? 💾

StatefulSets are generally used together with persistent volumes (PV) and persistent volume claims (PVC) to maintain application state. Before creating a StatefulSet, we need to configure these storage resources:

### First, we create a PV and PVC:
```bash
kubectl apply -f pv-pvc.yaml
```

### Then, we create the StatefulSet:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: nginx-sts
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "64Mi"
            cpu: "250m"
          limits:
            memory: "128Mi"
            cpu: "500m"
        volumeMounts:
        - name: nginx-data
          mountPath: /var/www/html
  volumeClaimTemplates:
  - metadata:
      name: nginx-data
    spec:
      accessModes: ["ReadWriteOnce"]
      storageClassName: "standard"
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 1Gi
```

An important characteristic of StatefulSets is that they require a "headless" service (ClusterIP: None). This service allows each StatefulSet pod to have a stable DNS address, which facilitates communication between pods.

When creating this StatefulSet, you'll notice that pods are created with predictable names:
- `nginx-sts-0`
- `nginx-sts-1`

## Use Cases and Limitations of DaemonSets and StatefulSets ��

### Use Cases for DaemonSets:
- **Monitoring agents**: like Prometheus, which need to run on each node ��
- **Log collection**: tools like Logstash or Fluentd 📝
- **Network proxies**: like kube-proxy 🌐
- **Storage daemons**: that need to run on each node ��

### Use Cases for StatefulSets:
- **Databases**: MySQL, PostgreSQL (for development, not always recommended for production) 🗄️
- **Distributed systems**: Kafka, Elasticsearch 🔄
- **Applications that require persistent identities** ��

### Limitations:
Both DaemonSets and StatefulSets have important restrictions to consider:

- **No immediate rollbacks** like Deployments ❌
- **Can only scale up or down one pod at a time** 📈
- This can affect user experience depending on the application domain ⚠️

It's important to understand these limitations to determine if these objects are suitable for your specific use case or if it would be better to use other alternatives like Deployments.

# Deploying a Multi-Tier Application Locally 🚀

## Summary 📋

How to deploy a test application with Kubernetes? Deploying applications in Kubernetes represents a great advantage for developers in cloud application management. This learning process is essential if you seek to efficiently scale your services. Using tools like Docker and Kubernetes is fundamental for achieving effective container orchestration in production. This is a topic that addresses everything from Docker integration to adaptation using Kubernetes. 🎯

## How is the Application Structured? 🏗️

The application consists of a backend and frontend, developed from advanced Docker course projects. These components are divided as follows:

### Backend (Python) 🐍
- **Route**: GET `/getmyinfo` that exposes a JSON
- **Exposed port**: 5001
- **Dockerfile**: Python Alpine image, installing Flask, Flask CORS, and Waitress

### Frontend (Nginx) 🌐
- **File copy**: Site files to `/usr/share/nginx/html`
- **Script execution**: `request.js` that makes a request to localhost:5001

## How to Use Docker Compose to Deploy This Application? 🐳

To manage this application, Docker Compose becomes an invaluable ally. It performs the following actions:

### Building the Containers:
```bash
docker-compose build
```

**Recommendation**: Some operating systems may require running `docker compose build` instead of `docker-compose build`.

### Running the Application:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

Validate that the frontend (port 8080) and backend (port 5001) are working through a browser.

## How to Adapt Your Deployment to Kubernetes? ⚙️

The transition to Kubernetes requires careful adaptation of the existing Docker application. Here's how:

### Creating Necessary YAML Files:
Configure deployment and service files for both backend and frontend.

### Running Services in Kubernetes:
- Use **MiniKube** which is ideal for local testing
- Change the service type from NodePort to LoadBalancer if connection errors occur

### Applying Changes:
```bash
kubectl apply -f backend/
kubectl apply -f frontend/
```

## What Additional Tools Can Be Used? 🛠️

### MiniKube:
You have the option to create a tunnel with `minikube service` to simulate traffic from your local machine.

### Editing and Deploying Services:

# Jobs and CronJobs: One-time and Scheduled Tasks ⏰

## Summary ��

Jobs and CronJobs in Kubernetes represent an elegant solution for executing scheduled or ephemeral tasks within your cloud infrastructure. These tools allow you to optimize resources, automate critical processes, and efficiently manage applications that don't need to be running constantly, such as backups, data migrations, or log cleanup. ��

## What Differentiates Jobs and CronJobs from Other Objects in Kubernetes? 🤔

Unlike deployments or statefulsets that maintain pods in continuous execution, Jobs and CronJobs are designed for tasks that must be executed once or repeatedly at specific intervals. The true value of these resources lies in their ability to execute complete processes and then release resources, something perfect for environments where optimization is crucial.

While a Job is used to execute a single task until completion, a CronJob allows scheduling the repetitive execution of jobs according to a temporal schedule defined using cron syntax.

## How is a Job Structured in Kubernetes? 🏗️

A basic Job in Kubernetes is created using a YAML file with this structure:

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: mysqlbackup
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql
        command: [
          "mysqldump", 
          "--host=mysql-service-sts", 
          "--user=root", 
          "--password=$(MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD)", 
          "$(MYSQL_DATABASE)", 
          "> /mnt/backup/mysql_backup_$(date +%F).sql"
        ]
        env:
          - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
            valueFrom:
              secretKeyRef:
                name: mysqlsecrets
                key: rootPassword
          - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
            valueFrom:
              secretKeyRef:
                name: mysqlsecrets
                key: database
        volumeMounts:
          - name: backup-volume
            mountPath: /mnt/backup
      volumes:
        - name: backup-volume
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: mysql-backup-pvc
      restartPolicy: Never
```

In this example, the job will execute a MySQL container that will perform a database backup using mysqldump. The key is the proper configuration of the command, environment variables obtained from secrets, and persistent volumes to store the result.

## How to Schedule Recurring Tasks with CronJobs? 📅

The CronJob extends the Job functionality by adding temporal scheduling:

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: mysqlbackup
spec:
  schedule: "*/1 * * * *"  # Execute every minute (only for example)
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: mysql
            image: mysql
            command: [
              "mysqldump", 
              "--host=mysql-service-sts", 
              "--user=root", 
              "--password=$(MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD)", 
              "$(MYSQL_DATABASE)", 
              "> /mnt/backup/mysql_backup_$(date +%F).sql"
            ]
            env:
              - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
                valueFrom:
                  secretKeyRef:
                    name: mysqlsecrets
                    key: rootPassword
              - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
                valueFrom:
                  secretKeyRef:
                    name: mysqlsecrets
                    key: database
            volumeMounts:
              - name: backup-volume
                mountPath: /mnt/backup
          volumes:
            - name: backup-volume
              persistentVolumeClaim:
                claimName: mysql-backup-pvc
          restartPolicy: Never
```

The differentiating element is the `schedule` property, which uses traditional cron notation:

- `"*/1 * * * *"`: Every minute
- `"0 0 * * *"`: Daily at midnight
- `"0 0 * * 1,3,5"`: Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at midnight

This pattern facilitates precise scheduling of recurring tasks according to your specific needs.

## What Use Cases Do Jobs and CronJobs Solve? 🎯

These Kubernetes objects are extremely versatile and can be applied in multiple scenarios:

### Database Scheduled Backups 💾
As we saw in the example, you can automate daily, weekly, or monthly backups.

### Log and Temporary File Cleanup 🧹
Avoid excessive storage consumption by deleting obsolete files.

### Periodic Report Generation 📊
Automate the creation and sending of business reports.

### Database Migrations 🔄
Execute migration scripts during updates without keeping the process permanently active.

### Maintenance Tasks 🔧
Database compaction, data analysis, batch processing, etc.

## Practical Tips for Implementing Jobs and CronJobs ��

When working with these objects in Kubernetes, consider these recommendations:

### Configure Realistic Execution Times ⏱️
In production environments, avoid excessively frequent scheduling like in the example (every minute).

### Use Appropriate PersistentVolumes 💾
Ensure that your job results are stored in persistent volumes with the necessary capacity.

### Monitor Executions 📈
Regularly review logs and completion status using `kubectl get jobs` or `kubectl get cronjobs`.

### Manage Secrets Correctly 🔐
As we saw in the example, typos in secret names (mysqlsecrets vs mysqlsecket) can cause execution failures.

### Debug Errors Methodically 🔍
When a job fails, use `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>` and `kubectl logs <pod-name>` to identify the source of the problem.

# Application Scaling: HPA and VPA 📈

## Summary 📋

Scalability in Kubernetes is a fundamental aspect to ensure that your applications can handle traffic fluctuations without compromising user experience. Through tools like Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) and Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA), you can implement efficient strategies that will allow your application to dynamically adapt to environmental demands, avoiding service degradation during traffic peaks like Black Friday. 🎯

## How Does Horizontal Scaling Work in Kubernetes? ⚖️

The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) is a native Kubernetes object that allows dynamically increasing or decreasing the number of pods within a deployment or StatefulSet based on specific metrics.

When we face a scenario like Black Friday, where traffic increases considerably, HPA allows us to respond automatically. Let's imagine the situation:

### Before Scaling 📊
We have a small pod on a worker node, with little traffic, functioning normally.

### During Traffic Peak 📈
HPA detects the increase in resource consumption.

### After Scaling 🚀
HPA automatically increases the number of pods associated with the same deployment to handle the additional load.

Unlike a common deployment, which can only have a fixed number of pods, HPA dynamically adjusts the number of replicas based on CPU consumption or other monitored resources.

## Important HPA Considerations ⚠️

When implementing HPA, you must consider several critical aspects:

### Dependency on Metrics 📊
You need to configure services like Metric Server so HPA can monitor resource consumption.

### Reactive Scaling, Not Proactive 🔄
HPA reacts to changes in demand but doesn't anticipate traffic peaks.

### Cluster Resource Limitation 🏗️
It cannot scale beyond the physical limits of your cluster.

### Focus on One Metric 📏
Generally CPU, which can be inefficient if you need to scale based on memory.

## What is Vertical Scaling and How to Implement It? 📏

The Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) offers a different approach: instead of increasing the number of pods, it allocates more resources to existing pods within a deployment.

Its operation is as follows:

### Before Scaling 📊
You have a small pod with limited resources (for example, 100m CPU and 100Mi memory).

### During Traffic Peak 📈
VPA detects the need for more resources.

### Scaling Process 🔄
VPA kills the existing pod and restarts it with more allocated resources (for example, 500m CPU and 500Mi memory).

## VPA Limitations to Consider ⚠️

VPA also has limitations that you must evaluate:

### Pod Restart 🔄
It kills pods to recreate them with new resources, which can cause interruptions.

### HPA Incompatibility ❌
VPA should not be used with HPA for the same metrics (CPU or memory) because they can conflict.

### Historical Data Dependency 📊
Requires robust monitoring and observability systems.

### Limited Configuration with Multi-Container Pods 📦
It kills all pod containers during the process, which can degrade service.

## How to Implement HPA and VPA in Practice? 🛠️

The implementation of HPA and VPA is done through YAML files with specific configurations:

### HPA Configuration ⚖️
```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: myapp-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: myApp-deployment
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 4
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 20
```

In this configuration:
- A scaling target is defined (a specific deployment)
- A minimum and maximum number of replicas is established (1 to 4)
- CPU utilization threshold is configured (20%)

### VPA Configuration ��
```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling.k8s.io/v1
kind: VerticalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: myapp-vpa
spec:
  targetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: myApp-deployment
  updatePolicy:
    updateMode: Auto
  resourcePolicy:
    containerPolicies:
      - containerName: '*'
        minAllowed:
          cpu: 1m
          memory: 4Mi
        maxAllowed:
          cpu: 8000m
          memory: 32Mi
        controlledResources: ["cpu", "memory"]
```

This configuration:
- Specifies the target deployment
- Defines an automatic update policy
- Establishes minimum and maximum limits for CPU and memory resources

For comprehensive VPA installation and configuration details, refer to the [official Kubernetes autoscaler documentation](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/vertical-pod-autoscaler/docs/installation.md).

## Scaling Test 🧪

To test scaling, we can generate artificial load:

```bash
kubectl run -i --tty load-generator --rm --image=busybox --restart=Never -- /bin/sh -c "while sleep 0.01; do wget -q -O- http://myapp-service; done"
```

This command creates a pod that makes constant requests to our service, allowing us to observe how scaling mechanisms react.

The expected result is that in the face of increased load, our application maintains optimal performance, avoiding degradation or delays, even during extreme traffic peaks.

## Advanced Scaling Configurations 🚀

### HPA with Custom Metrics:
```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler

        name: main-route
      target:
        type: Value
        value: 10k
```

### VPA with Update Modes:
```yaml

        cpu: 1
        memory: 500Mi
      controlledResources: ["cpu", "memory"]
      controlledValues: RequestsAndLimits
```

# Application Scaling in Kubernetes 📈

## Summary 📋

How does scaling work in Kubernetes? Scaling is vital for an application to function correctly in a production environment. Kubernetes offers three main scaling options: horizontal pod scaling, vertical pod scaling, and cluster scaling. Each approach has unique benefits and specific applications that make it suitable for different operational needs. 🎯

## How Does Scaling Work in Kubernetes? ⚙️

Scaling is vital for an application to function correctly in a production environment. Kubernetes offers three main scaling options: horizontal pod scaling, vertical pod scaling, and cluster scaling. Each approach has unique benefits and specific applications that make it suitable for different operational needs.

## What is the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler? ⚖️

Horizontal scaling in Kubernetes involves creating multiple instances of a pod to manage an increasing workload. This approach is ideal when an application requires more instances to handle an increase in incoming requests.

### Trigger Factors 🎯
The system can increase the number of pods if it detects that existing ones are near their maximum capacity, either due to CPU or memory usage.

### Configuration ⚙️
You can define thresholds, such as 80% CPU usage, to trigger new pods. The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) specification in the YAML file includes these criteria, allowing dynamic resource allocations based on demand.

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: my-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: my-deployment
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 5
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 80
```

## How Does the Vertical Pod Autoscaler Work? 📏

Vertical scaling allows adapting a single pod to have more resources (CPU, RAM) without replicating multiple instances. This option is beneficial when additional resources are needed in a single pod to process more intensive tasks without falling into performance problems.

### Process 🔄
The original pod is eliminated and replaced by a more powerful one, which significantly increases the capacity to handle the same process.

### Advantages ✅
Lower impact on the client application, since there's no need to manage multiple pods, but rather adapt a single one to new load requirements.

## What Advantages Does Cluster Autoscaler Bring? 🏗️

Cluster scaling complements a Kubernetes installation's ability to adapt to both internal and external conditions. By scaling the infrastructure itself, a cluster can have more master and worker nodes when traffic or workload demands increase.

### Flexible Infrastructure 🏢
It can add more nodes as demand grows, which eliminates bottlenecks in the cluster.

### Adaptability 🔄
Ideal for cloud environments, such as AWS, GCP, and Azure, where scalability and costs can be balanced according to real-time required operations.

## How to Configure Metrics for Scaling? 📊

We encounter an essential need: having metrics so that autoscalers (HPA, VPA) can make informed decisions. Kubernetes requires the metric-server to monitor and provide updated data on CPU and memory usage.

### Configure Metric Server:
```bash
minikube addons enable metrics-server
```

### Usage Advantages 🎯
Allows establishing realistic resource consumption and adjusting thresholds with precision, optimizing cluster efficiency.

# Kubernetes Configuration in GKE (Google) ☁️

## Summary 📋

Cloud Kubernetes services represent a significant evolution in container management, offering advanced capabilities that facilitate application deployment and administration. Each cloud service provider has its particularities, advantages, and unique characteristics that can influence our decision when choosing a platform. In this content, we'll explore how to configure Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), one of the most up-to-date providers in the Kubernetes ecosystem. ��

## What is Google Kubernetes Engine and Why Use It? ��

Google Kubernetes Engine is a managed Kubernetes service that allows you to deploy and manage containerized applications at scale on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) infrastructure. One of the main advantages of GKE is that it always has the latest versions of Kubernetes available, which is not surprising considering that Kubernetes was originally a Google initiative.

Additionally, GKE offers:

- **Support for advanced Kubernetes features** 🚀
- **Automatic cluster updates** 🔄
- **Integration with other Google Cloud services** 🔗
- **Multiple storage and networking options** 💾

To start working with GKE, we need to have a GCP account configured beforehand. If you're a new user, you'll likely receive free credits as part of the trial period that Google Cloud offers.

## How to Configure Our First Cluster in GKE? 🛠️

Before creating our Kubernetes cluster in GKE, we need to ensure we have the Google Cloud SDK installed and enable the necessary APIs. The main steps are:

### Environment Setup ⚙️

#### Install Google Cloud SDK (if you don't have it already installed):

[Gcloud instalation guide](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install-sdk?hl=es-419#linux)

```bash
# For macOS
curl https://sdk.cloud.google.com | bash
exec -l $SHELL

# For Windows
# Download and install from https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install
```

#### Authenticate with your Google account:
```bash
gcloud auth login
```

This command will open a window in your browser for you to select your Google account and grant the necessary permissions.

#### Enable the required APIs:
```bash
gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable compute.googleapis.com
```

These commands activate the containers API and compute API respectively, which are necessary for working with GKE.

### Cluster Creation 🏗️

Once our environment is configured, we can create our first Kubernetes cluster with the following command:

```bash
gcloud container clusters create k8s-course-demo --num-nodes=2
```

This command will create a cluster called "k8s-course-demo" with 2 nodes. The creation process can take between 15 and 20 minutes, during which Google Cloud will provision the necessary resources, configure the network, and deploy Kubernetes components.

During creation, we can monitor progress from the Google Cloud console, in the Kubernetes Engine section, where we'll see information such as:

- **Cluster status** 📊
- **General configuration** ⚙️
- **Installed Kubernetes version** 🔢
- **Public and private endpoints** ��
- **Nodes and node pools** 🖥️
- **Available storage classes** 💾

### Kubectl Configuration for Cluster Access 🔧

After creating the cluster, we need to configure kubectl to interact with it. GKE requires an additional plugin for authentication:

```bash
gcloud components install gke-gcloud-auth-plugin
```

This plugin is necessary for kubectl to communicate with our cloud cluster.

Once the plugin is installed, we can verify that we have access to the cluster:

```bash
kubectl config get-contexts
```

This command will show all available contexts, with an asterisk indicating the active context, which should be our newly created GKE cluster.

## What Installed Components Can We Find in Our GKE Cluster? 🔍

One of the advantages of using a managed service like GKE is that many essential components come pre-installed and configured. To see these components, we can execute:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n kube-system
```

Among the components installed by default, we'll find:

- **FluentBit**: for log collection and processing 📝
- **Google Kubernetes Engine metrics** 📊
- **Container Storage Interface (CSI)**: for storage management 💾
- **Metric Server**: for resource metrics 📈
- **kube-proxy**: essential component of Kubernetes architecture ��
- **CoreDNS**: for DNS resolution within the cluster 🔍
- **Other system components** ⚙️

## Advanced GKE Configurations 🚀

### Regional Cluster:
```bash
gcloud container clusters create regional-cluster \
    --region=us-central1 \
    --num-nodes=3 \
    --enable-autoscaling \
    --min-nodes=1 \
    --max-nodes=10
```

### Private Cluster:
```bash
gcloud container clusters create private-cluster \
    --region=us-central1 \

```bash
gcloud container clusters create workload-identity-cluster \
    --region=us-central1 \
    --num-nodes=3 \
    --workload-pool=my-project.svc.id.goog
```

## Working with Our Cluster 🎯

With our cluster running, we can start creating namespaces and deploying applications:

```bash
kubectl create namespace platzi
kubectl get namespaces
```

These commands create and then list the available namespaces, including the one we just created.

## GKE-Specific Features 🌟

### Node Pools Management:
```bash
# Create a new node pool
gcloud container node-pools create high-mem-pool \
    --cluster=k8s-course-demo \
    --region=us-central1 \
    --machine-type=e2-highmem-4 \
    --num-nodes=2

# Scale existing node pool
gcloud container clusters resize k8s-course-demo \
    --region=us-central1 \
    --num-nodes=5
```

### Cluster Updates:
```bash
# Check available versions
gcloud container get-server-config --region=us-central1

# Upgrade cluster
gcloud container clusters upgrade k8s-course-demo \
    --region=us-central1 \
    --master
```

### Monitoring and Logging:
```bash
# Enable monitoring
gcloud container clusters update k8s-course-demo \
    --region=us-central1 \
    --enable-stackdriver-kubernetes

# Enable logging
gcloud container clusters update k8s-course-demo \
    --region=us-central1 \
    --enable-logging
```

# Kubernetes Configuration in AKS (Azure) ☁️

## Summary ��

Cloud application deployment has become an indispensable skill in the current DevOps ecosystem. Mastering platforms like Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) not only allows you to optimize your workflows but also positions you competitively in the job market. We'll explore step by step how to create and configure a Kubernetes cluster in Azure, one of the most in-demand solutions by companies seeking cloud infrastructure professionals. 🎯

## Why is AKS Important in the DevOps Ecosystem? 🚀

Azure Kubernetes Service is a managed Kubernetes solution that significantly simplifies the deployment and management of containerized applications. One of the most notable advantages of AKS is its native integration with Azure DevOps, allowing complete automation of the flow from development to production.

Organizations increasingly seek professionals who master these technologies because they:

- **Facilitate the implementation of continuous integration practices** 🔄
- **Allow infrastructure management as code** 📝
- **Offer native scalability and high availability** ��
- **Simplify microservices management** ��️

Like GCP and AWS, Azure offers its own Kubernetes service, but with particularities that make it unique in the market.

## How to Create a Kubernetes Cluster in Azure? 🛠️

### Prerequisites 📋

Before starting with cluster creation, we need:

- **Azure account configured** 💳
- **Azure CLI installed on our local machine** 💻
- **Kubectl installed as an add-on** ��

To verify that we have the Azure CLI correctly installed, we execute:

```bash
az --version
```

If it's necessary to install the kubectl add-on for Azure, we use:

```bash
az aks install-cli
```

### Login and Initial Configuration ��

The first step is to authenticate our local CLI with Azure:

```bash
az login
```

This command will open a browser window where we must log in with our Azure account. Once authenticated, we must select the subscription with which we want to work.

It's important to remember that we need an active subscription with a payment method configured, although Azure offers a free tier for new users.

### Resource Group Creation 📁

In Azure, all resources must be associated with a resource group, which serves as a logical container. To create one:

```bash
az group create --name K8sCourseAksDemo --location eastus
```

This group will allow us to centrally manage:

- **Billing of our services** 💰
- **Security policies** 🔒
- **Resource monitoring** 📊
- **Shared configurations** ⚙️

### Kubernetes Cluster Creation 🏗️

Now we can create our AKS cluster using the resource group:

```bash
az aks create --resource-group K8sCourseAksDemo --name K8sCourseAksDemo \
              --node-count 3 --enable-addons monitoring --generate-ssh-keys \
              --node-vm-size Standard_DS2_v3
```

The key parameters we must understand are:

- `--node-count`: specifies how many nodes (virtual machines) our cluster will have
- `--enable-addons monitoring`: activates cluster monitoring
- `--generate-ssh-keys`: creates SSH keys to connect to nodes
- `--node-vm-size`: defines the type of virtual machine to use

During this process, we may face some common errors:

#### Service Providers Not Registered:
```bash
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.OperationsManagement
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService
```

#### VM Sizes Not Available:
We must specify a VM size compatible with our subscription and region.

## How to Connect Local Kubectl with Our AKS Cluster? 🔗

Once the cluster is created (a process that can take 15-20 minutes), we need to configure kubectl to communicate with it:

```bash
az aks get-credentials --resource-group K8sCourseAksDemo --name K8sCourseAksDemo
```

This command automatically adds the necessary configuration to our kubeconfig file. To verify that we have access to the cluster:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

We should see three nodes in "Ready" state. We can also explore system components:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n kube-system
```

This will show essential components such as:

- **CoreDNS for internal DNS resolution** 🔍
- **Azure CNI for networking** 🌐
- **Metrics and monitoring** 📊
- **Storage components (CSI)** 💾

## Advanced AKS Configurations 🚀

    --name workload-identity-cluster \
    --node-count 3 \
    --enable-oidc-issuer \
    --enable-workload-identity
```

## Resource Creation in Our Cluster 🎯

Already with the connection established, we can create resources like namespaces:

```bash
kubectl create namespace platzi-aks
```

And from here we could start deploying our applications, following the same principles we've applied locally.

# Deploying the Project in AWS Cloud (EKS) 🚀

## Summary ��

How can we deploy an application in a Kubernetes cluster in the cloud? Deploying an application in a Kubernetes (K8s) cluster in the cloud is a process that will require several steps to ensure all components are aligned and operational. Below, we explore the process, necessary configurations, and best practices to achieve a successful implementation. 🎯

## What Prerequisites are Essential? 📋

To begin, make sure you meet certain basic prerequisites necessary for deployment:

### EKS Cluster in AWS ☁️
You must have previously created an Elastic Kubernetes Service cluster within your AWS account.

### RDS Database 🗄️
You must have an Amazon RDS database instance configured so that pods can interact with this database.

### Docker Registries ��
Have the necessary Docker registries configured for your backend and frontend applications.

With these elements in place, you'll be ready to proceed with deployment.

## How Do We Organize Resources in Namespaces? ��

A common practice in Kubernetes is to segment resources in namespaces, which allow logical and organizational order:

### Backend Namespace 🔧
Hosting all components related to the server side.

### Frontend Namespace ��
Including all user interface components.

### Storage Namespace 💾
For managing the persistence layer, such as storage and databases. Here you can create an ExternalName service that connects to the RDS database.

Creating specific namespaces not only organizes your resources but also helps in configuring access and policies.

```bash
kubectl create namespace backend
kubectl create namespace frontend
kubectl create namespace storage
```

## How Do We Configure Connection with External Services? 🔗

To connect to an RDS database, you can use an ExternalName service that will point to the database:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
  namespace: storage
spec:
  type: ExternalName
  externalName: your-rds-endpoint.amazonaws.com
```

## How Do We Manage Sensitive Information in Kubernetes? 🔐

Managing sensitive data in Kubernetes must be handled with extreme care. Using secrets for values like passwords is a good practice:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic mysql-secret \
  --from-literal=username=admin \
  --from-literal=password=k8s \
  --from-literal=host=your-rds-endpoint.amazonaws.com \
  -n backend
```

To ensure confidentiality, Kubernetes encrypts secrets in storage, making them secure and protected.

## How Do We Initialize Our Database? ��️

Initializing the database can involve creating tables and other initial processes, defined through scripts. These scripts are executed through a Kubernetes Job.

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: init-db
  namespace: backend
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: db-init
          image: image-used-to-initialize
          volumeMounts:
            - name: config-volume
              mountPath: /init-scripts
          envFrom:
            - secretRef:
                name: mysql-secret
      volumes:
        - name: config-volume
          configMap:
            name: db-scripts
      restartPolicy: OnFailure
```

## How Do We Build Images for Different Architectures? 🏗️

When working with Docker for different architectures, such as ARM machines and AMD clusters, Buildx becomes essential for multi-platform compilation:

```bash
docker buildx build --platform=linux/amd64 -t my-registry/my-app:tag .
docker push my-registry/my-app:tag
```

## How Do We Configure and Deploy Our Application? ⚙️

After building, it's crucial to validate your deployment file configurations:

### Validate Deployment YAML ✅
Check that the reference to images and configurations are correct.

### Health Checks 🏥
Use readiness and liveness probes to ensure the service is available and functioning as expected.

### External Access 🌐
Configure LoadBalancer services to facilitate external access to the application.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
  namespace: backend
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-app
        image: my-registry/my-app:tag
        ports:
        - containerPort: 5001
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: mysql-secret
```

## Conclusion 🎯

By ensuring each of these steps, you'll be able to deploy robust and flexible applications in Kubernetes, supporting any business to achieve the desired scale and efficiency. Keep exploring and adapting new practices to continue improving! 💪

# Troubleshooting in Kubernetes 🔧

## Summary 📋

How to solve common errors in Kubernetes? Working with Kubernetes in production and development environments can be complicated due to its complex architecture. However, using debugging tools and metrics, it's possible to efficiently solve problems that may arise when managing clusters. Below, we'll explore how to resolve some of the most common errors in Kubernetes through a series of practical exercises. 🎯

## How to Identify Errors in Pods? 🔍

To detect errors in pods, we must use appropriate kubectl commands. For example, the `kubectl describe pod` command provides detailed information about the pod's state, including problems related to images and secrets.

```bash
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n <namespace>
```

### Image Download Errors 🖼️
The `image pull backoff` error indicates that the image cannot be downloaded, probably because the tag is incorrect. Verify if the image and its version are in the registry.

### Configuration Errors ⚙️
If the pod cannot start the container correctly, review the associated secrets and configmaps. Use the `kubectl get secret` command to verify secret names in the namespace.

## How to Solve Memory and CPU Problems? ��

A common error in clusters is OOM kills or memory shortage errors. It's fundamental to properly allocate resources and leave margin for pod scaling.

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "256Mi"
    cpu: "50m"
  limits:
    memory: "512Mi"
    cpu: "100m"
```

Adjust these configurations to avoid constant container restarts due to resource shortages.

## How to Ensure Database Connectivity? 🔗

To connect a pod with a database, ensure that the instance's security group allows traffic from the cluster's node group. Modify this configuration in the database management console.

```bash
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n <namespace>
```

Use `kubectl exec` to access the container's terminal and validate the connection with the MySQL client command.

## Strategies for Debugging Applications 🐛

### Logs and Events 📝
Review pod logs using `kubectl logs` to get details of recent events:

```bash
kubectl logs <pod-name> -n <namespace>
```

### Automation 🤖
Employ tools that automate error identification. This reduces manual efforts and increases operational efficiency.

### Service Validation ✅
Check service exposure through URLs and verify expected responses or empty sections.

```bash
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -n <namespace> -- /bin/sh
```

## Successful Execution After Corrections ✅

After making adjustments and checking logs, verify that the application reaches a successful running state. Check the pods again and ensure that previous errors have been corrected.

## Best Practices for Troubleshooting 🎯

### 1. Check Pod Status 📊
```bash
kubectl get pods -n <namespace>
kubectl get events -n <namespace>
```

### 2. Verify Resource Usage 📈
```bash
kubectl top pods -n <namespace>
kubectl top nodes
```

### 3. Inspect Service Configuration 🌐
```bash
kubectl get services -n <namespace>
kubectl describe service <service-name> -n <namespace>
```

### 4. Check Network Connectivity 🌍
```bash
kubectl run test-pod --image=busybox --rm -it --restart=Never -- nslookup <service-name>
```

## Common Error Patterns and Solutions 🔧

| Error Type | Symptoms | Solution |
|------------|----------|----------|
| ImagePullBackOff | Pod stuck in pending | Check image name and registry access |
| CrashLoopBackOff | Pod restarts repeatedly | Check application logs and resource limits |
| OOMKilled | Pod terminated | Increase memory limits or optimize application |
| Pending | Pod not scheduled | Check node resources and taints/tolerations |

## Conclusion 🎯

This meticulous approach to debugging problems in the Kubernetes cluster will provide you with the tools and knowledge necessary to handle production environments competently. Continue learning and experimenting with various cases to strengthen your skills and ensure successful deployment in the future. The world of Kubernetes is vast and full of opportunities for continuous improvement! 💪
