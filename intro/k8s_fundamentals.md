# Kubernetes Architecture: Nodes, Pods, and Key Components 🏗️

## Summary 📋

Container orchestration with Kubernetes represents one of the most significant advances in modern application management. Its robust and elegant architecture allows companies to deploy scalable and fault-tolerant solutions in real production environments. Below, we'll explore in detail the components that make Kubernetes such a powerful and versatile tool for cloud application deployment. 🎭

For comprehensive information about Kubernetes architecture and features, visit the [official Kubernetes website](https://kubernetes.io/).

## How is the Kubernetes Architecture Structured? 🏛️

The Kubernetes architecture is fundamentally based on servers organized into two main categories: **master nodes** and **worker nodes**. This hierarchical structure allows for clear separation of responsibilities within the cluster. 🏢

**Master nodes** house what is known as the "control plane," the operational brain of Kubernetes. For production environments, it's recommended to have more than one server in this layer to ensure high availability and resilience against failures. In smaller development environments, a single master node may be sufficient. 🎭

On the other hand, **worker nodes** (also called slaves) are responsible for managing computational workloads. The number of worker nodes varies according to the volume of running applications and the system's resource requirements. ⚙️

## What are the Key Components of the Control Plane? 🎛️

When examining master nodes in detail, we find several essential components that make up the control plane:

### API Server 🚪
It's the entry point for all communication within the cluster. When you run a command like `kubectl get pods`, it reaches the API Server, which communicates with other components to provide the appropriate response.

### etcd 💾
This high-concurrency key-value database records every change made, ensuring the cluster always maintains its desired state updated. It functions as the persistent "memory" of Kubernetes.

### Controller Manager 🎮
It's not a single controller, but a set of them that monitor different aspects of the cluster:

- **Node Controller**: Verifies the health of all nodes
- **Replication Controller**: Ensures the correct number of pods exist
- **Endpoint Controller**: Manages communication between services

### Scheduler 📅
Decides on which node each pod will run, based on required resources (CPU, memory, GPU) and available resources on each worker node.

## What Components are Found in Worker Nodes? 🔧

Worker nodes contain equally important components:

### Kubelet 🎮
This agent runs on each worker node and communicates with the API Server to ensure containers function correctly. If it detects errors, it reports them so corrective actions can be taken.

### kube-proxy 🌐
Manages the cluster's network layer, facilitating communication between pods and with the outside world.

### Container Runtime Interface (CRI) 🐳
It's responsible for running containers within the node. Although Docker was previously used by default, recent versions of Kubernetes have migrated to containerd.

## How are Workloads Organized in Kubernetes? 📦

Kubernetes uses important concepts to organize and manage workloads efficiently:

### What are Namespaces and What is Their Function? 🏷️

Namespaces provide logical separation of resources within the cluster. This organization depends on each company's specific use case:

- Some teams define namespaces by application type (frontend/backend)
- Others prefer to organize by functional teams (payments, user interface, API)
- The important thing is that Kubernetes adapts to any use case without issues

Within these namespaces live the pods, which are the fundamental unit of Kubernetes. A pod can contain one or multiple containers, depending on specific needs.

### How do Services Manage Communication in Kubernetes? 🔗

Services are components that accept traffic and redirect it to specific groups of pods. There are different types:

- **NodePort**: Primarily used in development environments, exposes a specific port on each worker node to allow external communication to pods. Not recommended for production environments.

- **ClusterIP**: Allows internal communication within the cluster through a specific IP. Facilitates load balancing between pods associated with the same application.

- **LoadBalancer**: When working with Kubernetes in the cloud, this type of service automatically creates a load balancer in the cloud service provider, ensuring more scalable and resilient traffic.

- **ExternalName**: Highly recommended for production environments, allows mapping a public name (like an RDS database in AWS) to a private name within the cluster. Optimizes communication times between internal and external services.

## How Does an Application Flow Work in Kubernetes? 🔄

Deploying an application in Kubernetes follows a well-defined process:

1. **Pod Deployment** 🎭: A pod is deployed within a specific namespace
2. **Scheduler Decision** 📅: The scheduler determines which worker node to place it on
3. **Container Startup** 🚀: The kubelet on that node starts the corresponding container
4. **Network Layer** 🌐: The kube-proxy establishes the network layer to allow communications
5. **Service Routing** 🔄: Services (like an Ingress or load balancer) redirect HTTP requests from the internet to the correct pods

This complete process allows Kubernetes to act as a true orchestra conductor, coordinating all elements so that our application functions optimally, scalably, and resilient to failures. 🎼

## Conclusion 🎉

Kubernetes architecture represents an elegant solution to modern computing challenges, enabling resilient and scalable deployments regardless of application complexity. The combination of master and worker nodes, along with the sophisticated control plane components, creates a robust foundation for container orchestration that can handle everything from simple applications to complex microservices architectures. 🌟

Knowing how to configure and manage Kubernetes efficiently is fundamental for any professional in the DevOps or systems administration area. With a cluster configured with MiniKube, we can begin exploring Kubernetes capabilities. Below, we offer you a step-by-step guide based on best practices so you can make the most of the tools at your disposal. 🛠️

For additional comprehensive notes and resources, check out the [Kubernetes Introduction Notes](https://memoescalona.notion.site/Kubernetes-Introducci-n-1b44fd7dd88780e89717f2ac4835ff5f).

## What is the First Step to Start with MiniKube and Kubernetes? 🚀

First, you must have the local cluster configured with MiniKube. This is an essential tool that allows you to manage your cluster locally, offering a flexible platform for different configurations, such as working with multiple nodes or different versions of Kubernetes. To start the cluster, we use the command:

```bash
minikube start --driver=docker
```

This command, in addition to lifting the cluster, can be complemented with various specific parameters according to your needs, such as the driver you prefer to use. ⚙️

## What is KubeCTL and How Do We Interact with Kubernetes? 🎮

KubeCTL is the essential bridge to your Kubernetes cluster's API server. Through it, we can make a variety of requests such as create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) resources. A basic example to query resources is the command:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

With this, we can list the active pods in our current namespace. However, to get more details, we can use:

```bash
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

## What are Namespaces and How to Manage Them? 🏷️

Namespaces are crucial for organizing and logically separating resources within Kubernetes. By default, the cluster has a "default" namespace, but you can create and delete additional ones as needed:

### Create a new namespace:

```bash
kubectl create namespace k8s-demo
```

### Validate namespace creation:

```bash
kubectl get namespaces
```

### Delete a namespace:

```bash
kubectl delete namespace k8s-demo
```

## How Do We Manage Nodes Within Kubernetes? 🖥️

An important aspect of Kubernetes is managing the nodes that make up the cluster, where we perform operations with:

### List nodes:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

### Describe a node:

```bash
kubectl describe node
```

These commands provide valuable information about the node's role, status, and resources.

## How Are Declarative and Imperative Operator Configurations Applied? ⚙️

Kubernetes allows two styles for managing configurations:

- **Declarative**: Uses YAML files to define the desired state of the system.
- **Imperative**: Executes commands directly to carry out a specific action.

To apply a pod using a YAML file imperatively, we use:

```bash
kubectl apply -f simple-pod.yaml
```

And to delete that pod if it's no longer needed:

```bash
kubectl delete pod <pod-name>
```

## How to Keep Our Cluster in Top Shape with MiniKube? 🔧

To customize our cluster and expand its functionalities, MiniKube offers various add-ons. Some essential ones for improving management are:

### Metric Server: 
For obtaining cluster metrics and auto-scaling possibilities.

```bash
minikube addons enable metrics-server
```

### Registry: 
Links the Docker registry with MiniKube.

```bash
minikube addons enable registry
```

These components are critical for efficient handling and smooth development within Kubernetes.

## Essential Kubectl Commands Cheat Sheet 📝
